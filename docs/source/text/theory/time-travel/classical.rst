Classical theories of time travel
*********************************

Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity is a geometric theory of gravitation which seeks to describe the effective mutual attraction between entities that possess mass. Within this theory, there exists an interesting class of objects called *closed timelike curves* (CTCs). Such objects are fascinating because a particle moving along one may travel back in time and interact with its past self, and so the geometries that permit the formation of CTCs are often colloquially known as *time machines*. It is because of this self-interaction that fictional depictions of time travel have captivated the interest of the public for more than a century, while both the validity and implications of the phenomenon have continually been discussed in the scientific literature.
