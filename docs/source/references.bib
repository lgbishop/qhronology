	abstract = {One of the most cited books in physics of all time, Quantum Computation and Quantum Information remains the best textbook in this exciting field of science. This 10th anniversary edition includes an introduction from the authors setting the work in context. This comprehensive textbook describes such remarkable effects as fast quantum algorithms, quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography and quantum error-correction. Quantum mechanics and computer science are introduced before moving on to describe what a quantum computer is, how it can be used to solve problems faster than 'classical' computers and its real-world implementation. It concludes with an in-depth treatment of quantum information. Containing a wealth of figures and exercises, this well-known textbook is ideal for courses on the subject, and will interest beginning graduate students and researchers in physics, computer science, mathematics, and electrical engineering.},

	abstract = {The D-CTC condition has originally been proposed by David Deutsch as a condition on states of a quantum communication network that contains “backward time-steps” in some of its branches. It has been argued that this is an analogue for quantum processes in the presence of closed timelike curves (CTCs). The unusual properties of states of quantum communication networks that fulfill the D-CTC condition have been discussed extensively in recent literature. In this work, the D-CTC condition is investigated in the framework of quantum field theory in the local, operator-algebraic approach due to Haag and Kastler. It is shown that the D-CTC condition cannot be fulfilled in states that are analytic in the energy, or satisfy the Reeh–Schlieder property, for a certain class of processes and initial conditions. On the other hand, if a quantum field theory admits sufficiently many uncorrelated states across acausally related spacetime regions (as implied by the split property), then the D-CTC condition can always be fulfilled approximately to arbitrary precision. As this result pertains to quantum field theory on globally hyperbolic spacetimes where CTCs are absent, one may conclude that interpreting the D-CTC condition as characteristic for quantum processes in the presence of CTCs could be misleading, and should be regarded with caution. Furthermore, a construction of the quantized massless Klein–Gordon field on the Politzer spacetime, often viewed as spacetime analogue for quantum communication networks with backward time-steps, is proposed in this work.},

	abstract = {I argue that Deutsch׳s model for the behavior of systems traveling around closed timelike curves (CTCs) relies implicitly on a substantive metaphysical assumption. Deutsch is employing a version of quantum theory with a significantly supplemented ontology of parallel existent worlds, which differ in kind from the many worlds of the Everett interpretation. Standard Everett does not support the existence of multiple identical copies of the world, which the D-CTC model requires. This has been obscured because he often refers to the branching structure of Everett as a “multiverse”, and describes quantum interference by reference to parallel interacting definite worlds. But he admits that this is only an approximation to Everett. The D-CTC model, however, relies crucially on the existence of a multiverse of parallel interacting worlds. Since his model is supplemented by structures that go significantly beyond quantum theory, and play an ineliminable role in its predictions and explanations, it does not represent a quantum solution to the paradoxes of time travel.},

Kay's proposal is that, in formulating algebraic quantum field theory on (M,g), F-locality should be imposed as a necessary condition on the *-algebra of observables.

The spacetimes studied are the two- and four-dimensional spacelike cylinders (Minkowski space quotiented by a timelike translation). Kay has shown that the four-dimensional spacelike cylinder is F-quantum compatible with massless fields. We prove that it is also F-quantum compatible with massive fields and prove the F-quantum compatibility of the two-dimensional spacelike cylinder with both massive and massless fields. In each case, F-quantum compatibility is proved by constructing a suitable F-local algebra.},

	abstract = {We study the classical and quantum theory of a class of nonlinear differential equations on models of chronology-violating spacetimes in which space consists of only finitely many discrete points. Classically, we study the initial value problem for data specified before the nonchronal region. In the linear and weakly coupled nonlinear regimes, we show (for generic choices of parameters) that solutions always exist and are unique; however, uniqueness (but not existence) fails in the strongly coupled regime. The evolution is shown to preserve the symplectic structure. The quantum theory is approached via the quantum initial value problem (QIVP), that is, by seeking operator-valued solutions to the equation of motion whose initial data form a representation of the canonical (anti)commutation relations. Using normal operator ordering, we construct solutions to the QIVP for both Bose and Fermi statistics (again for generic choice of parameters) and prove that these solutions are unique. For models with two spatial points, the resulting evolution is unitary; however, for a more general model the evolution fails to preserve the (anti)commutation relations and is, therefore, nonunitary. We show that this nonunitary evolution cannot be described using a superscattering operator with the usual properties. The classical limit is discussed and numerical evidence is presented to show that the bosonic quantum theory picks out a unique classical solution for certain ranges of the coupling strength, but that the classical limit fails to exist for other values of the coupling. We also show that the quantum theory depends strongly on the choice of operator ordering. In addition, we compare our results with those obtained using the "self-consistent path integral" and find that they differ. It follows that the evolution obtained from the path integral does not correspond to a solution to the equation of motion.},

Yet, phase shifts can always be explained as arising because of an Aharonov–Bohm effect, where a particle in a flat space–time is subject to an effective potential. Here we propose a quantum effect that cannot be explained without the general relativistic notion of proper time. We consider interference of a 'clock'—a particle with evolving internal degrees of freedom—that will not only display a phase shift, but also reduce the visibility of the interference pattern. According to general relativity, proper time flows at different rates in different regions of space–time. Therefore, because of quantum complementarity, the visibility will drop to the extent to which the path information becomes available from reading out the proper time from the 'clock'. Such a gravitationally induced decoherence would provide the first test of the genuine general relativistic notion of proper time in quantum mechanics.},

Simple examples are the timenonorientable spacetimes whose orientable double cover is globally hyperbolic. These spacetimes have generalized Cauchy surfaces on which smooth initial data sets yield unique solutions. A more difficult problem is to characterize the class of spacetimes with closed timelike curves that admit a well-posed initial value problem. Examples of spacetimes with closed timelike curves are given for which smooth initial data at past null infinity has been recently shown to yield solutions. These solutions appear to be unique, and uniqueness has been proved in particular cases. Other examples, however, show that confining closed timelike curves to compact regions is not sufficient to guarantee uniqueness. An approach to the characterization problem is suggested by the behavior of congruences of null rays. Interacting fields have not yet been studied, but particle models suggest that uniqueness (and possibly existence) is likely to be lost as the strength of the interaction increases.},

He also solved the more general problem involving the electric field. Levi Civita, by slightly different methods, obtained solutions differing from those of Weyl in one respect, and discussed fully the case in which the field is produced by an infinite cylinder. R. Bach has discussed the special case of two spheres and has calculated their mutual attraction. Bach also considered the field of a slowly rotating sphere, and obtained approximate solutions, taking the Schwarz child solution as his zero-th approximation. The same field was discussed earlier by Leuse and Thirring, who considered, the linear terms, only, in the gravitational equation. Kornel Lanczos has also considered a special case of stationary fields and applied the results to cosmological problems. The more general case of gravitational fields produced by matter in stationary rotation has been treated by W. R. Andress and E. Akeley. Both these authors obtain approximate solutions of the general problem, and the latter treats at length the field of a rotating fluid. The object of this paper is to present some special, but exact, solutions which the author obtained some years ago and, also, two methods of successive approximation for obtaining solutions of a more general type, which behave in an assigned manner at infinity and on a surface of revolution enclosing the rotating matter to which the field is due. Our solutions include as special cases the solutions of Weyl, Levi Civita and others which pertain to static fields. Also, the approximate solutions for stationary fields obtained by Leuse and Thirring, Bach and Andress are contained in our solutions when appropriate choice of boundary conditions is made and higher order terms are neglected.},

	abstract = {This is the fifth, expanded edition of the comprehensive textbook published in 1990 on the theory and applications of path integrals. It is the first book to explicitly solve path integrals of a wide variety of nontrivial quantum-mechanical systems, in particular the hydrogen atom. The solutions have been made possible by two major advances. The first is a new euclidean path integral formula which increases the restricted range of applicability of Feynman's time-sliced formula to include singular attractive 1/r- and 1/r2-potentials. The second is a new nonholonomic mapping principle carrying physical laws in flat spacetime to spacetimes with curvature and torsion, which leads to time-sliced path integrals that are manifestly invariant under coordinate transformations.

In addition to the time-sliced definition, the author gives a perturbative, coordinate-independent definition of path integrals, which makes them invariant under coordinate transformations. A consistent implementation of this property leads to an extension of the theory of generalized functions by defining uniquely products of distributions.

The powerful Feynman-Kleinert variational approach is explained and developed systematically into a variational perturbation theory which, in contrast to ordinary perturbation theory, produces convergent results. The convergence is uniform from weak to strong couplings, opening a way to precise evaluations of analytically unsolvable path integrals in the strong-coupling regime where they describe critical phenomena.

Tunneling processes are treated in detail, with applications to the lifetimes of supercurrents, the stability of metastable thermodynamic phases, and the large-order behavior of perturbation expansions. A variational treatment extends the range of validity to small barriers. A corresponding extension of the large-order perturbation theory now also applies to small orders.

Special attention is devoted to path integrals with topological restrictions needed to understand the statistical properties of elementary particles and the entanglement phenomena in polymer physics and biophysics. The Chern–Simons theory of particles with fractional statistics (anyons) is introduced and applied to explain the fractional quantum Hall effect.

The relevance of path integrals to financial markets is discussed, and improvements of the famous Black–Scholes formula for option prices are developed which account for the fact, recently experienced in the world markets, that large fluctuations occur much more frequently than in Gaussian distributions.},

	abstract = {A world is to be considered stationary in the sense of general relativity if the coefficients of its metric are independent of time in a coordinate system in which the masses are at rest on average. The remark on the system of coordinates is important because time itself is no invariant notion but is taken only in the sense of proper time. Our definition is unique, in the form given above. On the other hand it is also possible to have points where no matter is present. At such points we may place a test body of infinitesimally small mass and analyse whether it remains at rest in our coordinate system. A necessary and sufficient condition for this is that the time lines of our coordinate system are geodesics. Therefore the static solution given by de Sitter is not an example of a stationary world. The Schwarzschild line element which, from a cosmological point of view, is a world with a single central body can also not be considered a stationary solution. Indeed, there are no stationary solutions which are also spherically symmetric for the original field equations. The only such solution for the cosmological equations is Einstein's cylinder world. It is, to my knowledge, the only stationary world known so far. In that case the average matter density and the total mass of the world has to have a well defined value given by the cosmological constant which doubtless would be purely coincidental and is thus not a satisfactory assumption. In the following we shall discuss a new solution which is in accord with the original field equations without the need of an a priori relation between mass and cosmological constant. However, we shall find that its mass cannot be less than the mass of the cylinder world.},

The physical framework he uses is derived from one of the major research frontiers of modern theoretical physics: quantum gravity the intersection of classical Einstein gravity and quantum field theory. About the Author Matt Visser is Research Assistant Professor at Washington University, St. Louis. He has lectured in the United States and abroad on topics including wormhole physics, time travel, and the chronology protection conjecture. He has conducted postdoctoral research at both the University of Southern California and at Los Alamos National Laboratory.},

For a class of static geometries of this type, and for smooth initial data with all derivatives in L 2 on ℐ −, we prove existence of smooth solutions which are regular at null and spatial infinity (have finite energy and finite L 2 -norm) and have the given initial data on ℐ −. A restricted uniqueness theorem is obtained, applying to solutions that fall off in time at any fixed spatial position. For a complementary class of spacetimes in which CTC’s are confined to a compact region, we show that when solutions exist they are unique in regions exterior to the CTC’s. (We believe that more stringent uniqueness theorems hold, and that the present limitations are our own.) An extension of these results to Maxwell fields and massless spinor fields is sketched. Finally, we discuss a conjecture whose meaning is essentially that the Cauchy problem for free fields is well defined in the presence of CTC’s whenever the problem is well-posed in a geometric-optics limit. We provide some evidence in support of this conjecture, and we present counterexamples that show that neither existence nor uniqueness is guaranteed under weaker conditions. In particular, both existence and uniqueness can fail in smooth, asymptotically flat spacetimes with a compact nonchronal region.},

We analyze globally consistent solutions of local equations of motion; namely, we find all trajectories with one self-collision. It is demonstrated that all standard initial conditions have a consistent evolution, including those paradoxical ones, for which the inconsistent collision-free trajectory is superseded by a special consistent self-colliding trajectory. Moreover, it is shown that for a wide class of initial conditions, more than one globally consistent evolution exist. The nontrivial causal structure thus breaks the uniqueness of the classical theory even for locally deterministic physical laws.},

A point-like body (particle) is an idealization of a small ideal elastic billiard ball. The known model of a time machine is used containing a wormhole leading to the past. If the body enters one of the mouths of the wormhole, it emerges from another mouth in an earlier time so that both the particle and its “incarnation” coexist during some time and may collide. Such self-collisions are considered in the case when the size of the body is much less than the radius of the mouth, and the latter is much less than the distance between the mouths. Three-dimensional configurations of trajectories with a self-collision are presented. Their dynamics is investigated in detail. Configurations corresponding to multiple wormhole traversals are discussed. It is shown that, for each world line describing self-collision of a particle, dynamically equivalent configurations exist in which the particle collides not with itself but with an identical particle having a closed trajectory (Jinnee of Time Machine).},

	abstract = {The effects of self-interaction in classical physics, in the presence of closed timelike curves, are probed by means of a simple model problem: The motion and self-collisions of a nonrelativistic, classical billiard ball in a space endowed with a wormhole that takes the ball backward in time. The central question asked is whether the Cauchy problem is well posed for this model problem, in the following sense: We define the multiplicity of an initial trajectory for the ball to be the number of self-consistent solutions of the ball’s equations of motion, which begin with that trajectory. For the Cauchy problem to be well posed, all initial trajectories must have multiplicity one.

A simple analog of the science-fiction scenario of going back in time and killing oneself is an initial trajectory which is dangerous in this sense: When followed assuming no collisions, the trajectory takes the ball through the wormhole and thereby back in time, and then sends the ball into collision with itself. In contrast with one’s naive expectation that dangerous trajectories might have multiplicity zero and thereby make the Cauchy problem ill posed (‘‘no solutions’’), it is shown that all dangerous initial trajectories in a wide class have infinite multiplicity and thereby make the Cauchy problem ill posed in an unexpected way: ‘‘far too many solutions.’’

The wide class of infinite-multiplicity, dangerous trajectories includes all those that are nearly coplanar with the line of centers between the wormhole mouths, and a ball and wormhole restricted by (ball radius)≪(wormhole radius)≪(separation between wormhole mouths). Two of the infinity of solutions are slight perturbations of the self-inconsistent, collision-free motion, and all the others are strongly different from it. Not all initial trajectories have infinite multiplicity: trajectories where the ball is initially at rest far from the wormhole have multiplicity one, as also, probably, do those where it is almost at rest. A search is made for initial trajectories with zero multiplicity, and none are found. The search entails constructing a set of highly nonlinear, coupled, algebraic equations that embody all the ball’s laws of motion, collision, and wormhole traversal, and then constructing perturbation theory and numerical solutions of the equations. A future paper (paper II) will show that, when one takes account of the effects of quantum mechanics, the classically ill-posed Cauchy problem (‘‘too many classical solutions’’) becomes quantum-mechanically well posed in the sense of producing unique probability distributions for the outcomes of all measurements.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02295},
	abstract = {Notoriously, the Einstein equations of general relativity have solutions in which closed timelike curves (CTCs) occur. On these curves time loops back onto itself, which has exotic consequences. However, in order to make time travel stories consistent constraints have to be satisfied, which prevents seemingly ordinary and plausible processes from occurring. This, and several other "unphysical" features, have motivated many authors to exclude solutions with CTCs from consideration, e.g. by conjecturing a chronology protection law. In this contribution we shall investigate the nature of one particular class of exotic consequences of CTCs, namely those involving unexpected cases of indeterminism or determinism. Indeterminism arises even against the backdrop of the usual deterministic physical theories when CTCs do not cross spacelike hypersurfaces outside of a limited CTC-region (such hypersurfaces fail to be Cauchy surfaces). By contrast, a certain kind of determinism appears to arise when an indeterministic theory is applied on a CTC: things cannot be different from what they already were. We shall argue that on further consideration both this indeterminism and determinism on CTCs turn out to possess analogues in other, familiar areas of physics. CTC-indeterminism is close to the epistemological indeterminism we know from statistical physics, while the "fixedness" typical of CTC-determinism is pervasive in physics. CTC-determinism and CTC-indeterminism therefore do not provide incontrovertible grounds for rejecting CTCs as conceptually inadmissible.},

Many objections are given against the use of black holes or Schwarzschild wormholes for rapid interstellar travel. A new class of solutions of the Einstein field equations is presented, which describe wormholes that, in principle, could be traversed by human beings. It is essential in these solutions that the wormhole possess a throat at which there is no horizon; and this property, together with the Einstein field equations, places an extreme constraint on the material that generates the wormhole’s spacetime curvature: In the wormhole’s throat that material must possess a radial tension τ0 with the enormous magnitude τ0∼ (pressure at the center of the most massive of neutron stars)×(20 km)2/(circumference of throat)2. Moreover, this tension must exceed the material’s density of mass‐energy, ρ0c2. No known material has this τ0{\textgreater}ρ0c2 property, and such material would violate all the ‘‘energy conditions’’ that underlie some deeply cherished theorems in general relativity. However, it is not possible today to rule out firmly the existence of such material; and quantum field theory gives tantalizing hints that such material might, in fact, be possible.},

We express the propagator explicitly in terms of those for the chronal spacetime and for the two wormholes; and from that expression we show that the propagator satisfies completeness and unitarity in the initial and final ‘‘chronal regions’’ (regions without closed timelike curves) and its propagation from the initial region to the final region is unitary. However, within the time machine it satisfies neither completeness nor unitarity. We also give an alternative proof of initial-region-to-final-region unitarity based on a conserved current and Gauss’s theorem. This proof can be carried over without change to most any nonrelativistic time-machine spacetime and it is valid as long as the particle is not interacting with itself or any other quantum particle; it can, however, interact with an external field (gravitational or otherwise). This result is the nonrelativistic version of a theorem by Friedman, Papastamatiou, and Simon, which says that for a free scalar field quantum-mechanical unitarity follows from the fact that the classical evolution preserves the Klein-Gordon inner product.},

In quantum mechanics the first of these pathologies does not occur. The second is mitigated, and may be avoidable without such spacetimes being ruled out. Several novel and distinctive (but nonparadoxical) quantum-mechanical effects occur on and near closed timelike lines, including violations of the correspondence principle and of unitarity. It becomes possible to "clone" quantum systems and to measure the state of a quantum system. A new experimental test of the Everett interpretation against all others becomes possible.

	abstract = {The Schwarzchild manifold of general relativity theory is unsatisfactory as a particle model because the singularity at the origin makes it geodesically incomplete. A coupling of the geometry of space‐time to a scalar field φ produces in its stead a static, spherically symmetric, geodesically complete, horizonless space‐time manifold with a topological hole, termed a drainhole, in its center. The coupling is Rμν=2φ,μφ,ν; its polarity is reversed from the usual to allow both the negative curvatures found in the drainhole and the completeness of the geodesics. The scalar field satisfies the scalar wave equation □φ=0 and has finite total energy whose magnitude, expressed as a length, is comparable to the drainhole radius. On one side of the drainhole the manifold is asymptotic to a Schwarzschild manifold with positive mass parameter m, on the other to a Schwarzschild manifold with negative mass parameter m̄, and − m̄ {\textgreater} m. The two‐sided particle thus modeled attracts matter on the one side and, with greater strength, repels it on the other. If m is one proton mass, then − m̄/m ≈ 1+10−19 or 1+10−39, according as the drainhole radius is close to 10−33cm or close to 10−13 cm; the ratios of total scalar field energy to m in these instances are 1019 and 1039. A radially directed vector field which presents itself is interpreted, for purposes of conceptualization, as the velocity of a flowing ``substantial ether'' whose nonrigid motions manifest themselves as gravitational phenomena. When the ether is at rest, the two‐sided particle has no mass on either side, but the drainhole remains open and is able to trap test particles for any finite length of time, then release them without ever accelerating them; some it can trap for all time without accelerating them. This massless, chargeless, spinless particle can, if disturbed, dematerialize into a scalar‐field wave propagating at the wave speed characteristic of the space‐time manifold.},

	abstract = {The laws of physics might permit the existence, in the real Universe, of closed timelike curves (CTC’s). Macroscopic CTC’s might be a semiclassical consequence of Planck-scale, quantum gravitational, Lorentzian foam, if such foam exists. If CTC’s are permitted, then the semiclassical laws of physics (the laws with gravity classical and other fields quantized or classical) should be augmented by a principle of self-consistency, which states that a local solution to the equations of physics can occur in the real Universe only if it can be extended to be part of a global solution, one which is well defined throughout the (nonsingular regions of) classical spacetime. The consequences of this principle are explored for the Cauchy problem of the evolution of a classical, massless scalar field Φ (satisfying □Φ=0) in several model spacetimes with CTC’s.

In general, self-consistency constrains the initial data for the field Φ. For a family of spacetimes with traversible wormholes, which initially possess no CTC’s and then evolve them to the future of a stable Cauchy horizon scrH, self-consistency seems to place no constraints on initial data for Φ that are posed on past null infinity, and none on data posed on spacelike slices which precede scrH.

By contrast, initial data posed in the future of scrH, where the CTC’s reside, are constrained; but the constraints appear to be mild in the sense that in some neighborhood of every event one is free to specify initial data arbitrarily, with the initial data elsewhere being adjusted to guarantee self-consistent evolution. A spacetime whose self-consistency constraints have this property is defined to be ‘‘benign with respect to the scalar field Φ.’’ The question is posed as to whether benign spacetimes in some sense form a generic subset of all spacetimes with CTC’s. It is shown that in the set of flat, spatially and temporally closed, 2-dimensional spacetimes the benign ones are not generic. However, it seems likely that every 4-dimensional, asymptotically flat space-time that is stable and has a topology of the form R×(S-one point), where S is a closed 3-manifold, is benign. Wormhole spacetimes are of this type, with S=S1×S2. We suspect that these types of self-consistency behavior of the scalar field Φ are typical for noninteracting (linearly superposing), classical fields.

However, interacting classical systems can behave quite differently, as is demonstrated by a study of the motion of a hard-sphere billiard ball in a wormhole spacetime with closed timelike curves: If the ball is classical, then some choices of initial data (some values of the ball’s initial position and velocity) give rise to unique, self-consistent motions of the ball; other choices produce two different self-consistent motions; and others might (but we are not yet sure) produce no self-consistent motions whatsoever. By contrast, in a path-integral formulation of the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics of such a billiard ball, there appears to be a unique, self-consistent set of probabilities for the outcomes of all measurements. This paper’s conclusion, that CTC’s may not be as nasty as people have assumed, is reinforced by the fact that they do not affect Gauss’s theorem and thus do not affect the derivation of global conservation laws from differential ones. The standard conservation laws remain valid globally, and in asymptotically flat, wormhole spacetimes they retain a natural, quasilocal interpretation.},

In this paper the quantum circuit approach is thoroughly reviewed, and the strengths and shortcomings of D-CTCs and P-CTCs are presented in view of their nonlinearity and time-travel paradoxes. In particular, the “equivalent circuit model”—which aims to make equivalent predictions to D-CTCs, while avoiding some of the difficulties of the original theory—is shown to contain errors. The discussion of D-CTCs and P-CTCs is used to motivate an analysis of the features one might require of a theory of quantum time travel, following which two overlapping classes of alternate theories are identified. One such theory, the theory of “transition probability” CTCs (T-CTCs), is fully developed. The theory of T-CTCs is shown not to have certain undesirable features—such as time-travel paradoxes, the ability to distinguish nonorthogonal states with certainty, and the ability to clone or delete arbitrary pure states—that are present with D-CTCs and P-CTCs. The problems with nonlinear extensions to quantum mechanics are discussed in relation to the interpretation of these theories, and the physical motivations of all three theories are discussed and compared.},

	abstract = {Closed timelike curves are among the most controversial features of modern physics. As legitimate solutions to Einstein’s field equations, they allow for time travel, which instinctively seems paradoxical. However, in the quantum regime these paradoxes can be resolved, leaving closed timelike curves consistent with relativity. The study of these systems therefore provides valuable insight into nonlinearities and the emergence of causal structures in quantum mechanics—essential for any formulation of a quantum theory of gravity. Here we experimentally simulate the nonlinear behaviour of a qubit interacting unitarily with an older version of itself, addressing some of the fascinating effects that arise in systems traversing a closed timelike curve. These include perfect discrimination of non-orthogonal states and, most intriguingly, the ability to distinguish nominally equivalent ways of preparing pure quantum states. Finally, we examine the dependence of these effects on the initial qubit state, the form of the unitary interaction and the influence of decoherence.},

We give examples for coherent, squeezed, and single-photon states interacting with the CTC via a beamsplitter. The model is then generalized further to account for the smooth transition to normal quantum mechanics as the CTC becomes much smaller than the size of the modes interacting on it.

At the classical level, they induce causal paradoxes disturbing enough to motivate conjectures that explicitly prevent their existence. At the quantum level such problems can be resolved through the Deutschian formalism, however this induces radical benefits—from cloning unknown quantum states to solving problems intractable to quantum computers. Instinctively, one expects these benefits to vanish if causality is respected. Here we show that in harnessing entanglement, we can efficiently solve NP-complete problems and clone arbitrary quantum states—even when all time-travelling systems are completely isolated from the past. Thus, the many defining benefits of Deutschian closed timelike curves can still be harnessed, even when causality is preserved. Our results unveil a subtle interplay between entanglement and general relativity, and significantly improve the potential of probing the radical effects that may exist at the interface between relativity and quantum theory.},

Non-intuitively, even the completely mixed CR qubit can be converted into a pure state after CTC qubit travels around the P-CTC. It is also shown that while D-CTC cannot increase the entanglement of CR system, P-CTC can increase it. This means that any partially entangled state can be maximally entangled pure state if P-CTC exists.

This solves an open problem proposed by one of us in 2005, and gives an essentially complete understanding of computational complexity in the presence of CTCs. Following the work of Deutsch, we treat a CTC as simply a region of spacetime where a ‘causal consistency’ condition is imposed, meaning that nature has to produce a (probabilistic or quantum) fixed point of some evolution operator. Our conclusion is then a consequence of the following theorem: given any quantum circuit (not necessarily unitary), a fixed point of the circuit can be (implicitly) computed in PSPACE.

Probability language helps to convey uncertainty about cause and effect relations but is insufficient to fully express those relations.

It is illustrated by a discussion of a spacetime in which two disks in flat space are indentified. If the disks have an imaginary time separation, this corresponds to a heat bath. An external field interacting with the heat bath will lose quantum coherence. One can then analytically continue to an almost real separation of the disks. This will give closed timelike curves but one will still get loss of quantum coherence. A comparison is made with the work of authors who find a nonunitary S matrix.

The effective interactions are small except for closed universes containing scalar particles in the spatially homogeneous mode. If these scalar interactions are not reduced by sypersymmetry, it may be that any scalar particles we observe would have to be bound states of particles of higher spin, such as the pion. An observer in the asymptotically flat region would not be able to measure the quantum state of closed universes that branched off.

We argue that a model of quantum computation in the presence of closed timelike curves can be formulated which represents a valid quantification of resources given the ability to construct compact regions of closed timelike curves. The notion of self-consistent evolution for quantum computers whose components follow closed timelike curves, as pointed out by Deutsch [Phys. Rev. D 44, 3197 (1991)], implies that the evolution of the chronology respecting components which interact with the closed timelike curve components is nonlinear. We demonstrate that this nonlinearity can be used to efficiently solve computational problems which are generally thought to be intractable. In particular we demonstrate that a quantum computer which has access to closed timelike curve qubits can solve NP-complete problems with only a polynomial number of quantum gates.},

	abstract = {The possible existence of closed timelike curves (CTCs) draws attention to fundamental questions about what is physically possible and what is not. An example is the "no cloning theorem" in quantum mechanics, which states that no physical means exists by which an unknown arbitrary quantum state can be reproduced or copied perfectly. Using the Deutsch approach, we show here that this theorem can be circumvented in the presence of closed timelike curves, allowing the cloning of an unknown arbitrary quantum state chosen from a finite alphabet of states. Since the "no cloning theorem" has played a central role in the development of quantum information science, it is clear that the existence of CTCs would radically change the rules for quantum information technology. Nevertheless we show that this type of cloning does not violate no-signalling criteria.},

Here, we prove that it is not possible to purify a mixed state that traverses a closed timelike curve (CTC) and is allowed to interact in a consistent way with a causality-respecting (CR) quantum system in the same manner. In other words, if a CTC quantum system with a mixed state has to undergo an arbitrary interaction with an arbitrary CR system then it has to be in a “proper” mixture, as it cannot be regarded as a subsystem of a pure entangled state. Thus, in general for arbitrary interactions between CR and CTC systems, there is no universal purification by embedding in a larger Hilbert space for mixed states with CTCs. This shows that in quantum theory with CTCs there can exist proper and improper mixtures.},

We show that this prescription is inconsistent with the assumption that one can verify the postulated nonlinear evolution. Specifically, if some agent can empirically verify the deterministic nonlinear action of a physical device for some set of pure-state inputs, then one cannot generally use density matrices to represent the input for a second agent who is ignorant of the actual pure state prepared. Our argument is epistemological and makes no appeal to the detailed physics of CTC's.},

The physical interpretation of such theories, however, is still unclear. We consider a large class of operationally-defined theories that contain "nonlinear boxes" and show that operational verifiability without superluminal signaling implies a split in the equivalence classes of preparation procedures. We conclude that any theory satisfying the above requirements is (a) inconsistent unless it contains distinct representations for the two different kinds of preparations and (b) incomplete unless it also contains a rule for uniquely distinguishing them at the operational level. We refer to this as the preparation problem for nonlinear theories. In addition to its foundational implications, this work shows that, in the presence of nonlinear quantum evolution, the security of quantum cryptography and the existence of other exotic effects remain open questions.},

Then, based on a suggestion of Bennett and Smith, we explicitly show how a party assisted by P-CTCs can distinguish a set of linearly independent quantum states, and we prove that it is not possible for such a party to distinguish a set of linearly dependent states. The power of P-CTCs is thus weaker than that of D-CTCs because the Holevo bound still applies to circuits using them, regardless of their ability to conspire in violating the uncertainty principle. We then discuss how different notions of a quantum mixture that are indistinguishable in linear quantum mechanics lead to dramatically differing conclusions in a nonlinear quantum mechanics involving P-CTCs. Finally, we give explicit circuit constructions that can efficiently factor integers, efficiently solve any decision problem in the intersection of NP and coNP, and probabilistically solve any decision problem in NP.

Here we show that a maximal uncertainty in the causal order forbids asymptotic quantum communication, while still enabling the noisy transfer of classical information. Therefore causal order, like shared entanglement, is an additional resource for communication. The result is formulated within an asymptotic setting for processes with no fixed causal order, which sets a basis for a quantum information theory in general quantum causal structures.},

	abstract = {When transforming pairs of independent quantum operations according to the fundamental rules of quantum theory, an intriguing phenomenon emerges: some such higher-order operations may act on the input operations in an indefinite causal order. Recently, the formalism of process matrices has been developed to investigate these noncausal properties of higher-order operations. This formalism predicts, in principle, statistics that ensure indefinite causal order even in a device-independent scenario, where the involved operations are not characterised. Nevertheless, all physical implementations of process matrices proposed so far require full characterisation of the involved operations in order to certify such phenomena. Here we consider a semi-device-independent scenario, which does not require all operations to be characterised. We introduce a framework for certifying noncausal properties of process matrices in this intermediate regime and use it to analyse the quantum switch, a well-known higher-order operation, to show that, although it can only lead to causal statistics in a device-independent scenario, it can exhibit noncausal properties in semi-device-independent scenarios. This proves that the quantum switch generates stronger noncausal correlations than it was previously known.},

This motivates the consideration of multipartite "noncausal" correlations that cannot be realised even if noncausal resources are made available to a smaller number of parties. Here we formalise this notion: genuinely N-partite noncausal correlations are those that cannot be produced by grouping N parties into two or more subsets, where a causal order between the subsets exists. We prove that such correlations can be characterised as lying outside a polytope, whose vertices correspond to deterministic strategies and whose facets define what we call "2-causal" inequalities. We show that genuinely multipartite noncausal correlations arise within the process matrix formalism, where quantum mechanics holds locally but no global causal structure is assumed, although for some inequalities no violation was found. We further introduce two refined definitions that allow one to quantify, in different ways, to what extent noncausal correlations correspond to a genuinely multipartite resource.},

The class of quantum transformations can be extended by including transformations on quantum operations, and transformations thereof, and so on up to the construction of a potentially infinite hierarchy of transformations. In the last decade, a sub-hierarchy, known as quantum combs, was exhaustively studied, and characterised as the most general class of transformations that can be achieved by quantum circuits with open slots hosting variable input elements, to form a complete output quantum circuit. The theory of quantum combs proved to be successful for the optimisation of information processing tasks otherwise untreatable. In more recent years the study of maps from combs to combs has increased, thanks to interesting examples showing how this next order of maps requires entanglement of the causal order of operations with the state of a control quantum system, or, even more radically, superpositions of alternate causal orderings. Some of these non-circuital transformations are known to be achievable and have even been achieved experimentally, and were proved to provide some computational advantage in various information-processing tasks with respect to quantum combs. Here we provide a formal language to form all possible types of transformations, and use it to prove general structure theorems for transformations in the hierarchy. We then provide a mathematical characterisation of the set of maps from combs to combs, hinting at a route for the complete characterisation of maps in the hierarchy. The classification is strictly related to the way in which the maps manipulate the causal structure of input circuits.},

These processes can be used to perform several tasks that are impossible in standard quantum mechanics: they allow for the violation of causal inequalities, and provide an advantage for computational and communication complexity. Nonetheless, no process that can be used to violate a causal inequality is known to be physically implementable. There is therefore considerable interest in determining which processes are physical and which are just mathematical artefacts of the framework. Here we make key progress in this direction by proposing a purification postulate: processes are physical only if they are purifiable. We derive necessary conditions for a process to be purifiable, and show that several known processes do not satisfy them.},

We criticize this choice of consistency condition from an epistemic perspective, i.e., a perspective in which the quantum state represents a state of knowledge about a system. We demonstrate that directly applying Deutsch’s condition when mixed states are treated as representing an observer’s knowledge of a system can conceal time travel paradoxes from the observer, rather than resolving them. To shed further light on the appropriate dynamics for quantum systems traversing CTCs, we make use of a toy epistemic theory with a strictly classical ontology due to Spekkens and show that, in contrast to the results of Deutsch, many of the traditional paradoxical effects of time travel are present.},

In a globally hyperbolic spacetime, the causal form of the propagator guarantees that the relations are satisfied, but for spacetimes with CTC's, the form of the propagator is altered, and we show that the unitarity relations are not satisfied for interacting fields.

We know how to describe quantum optics of ring resonators, and the resulting description agrees with experiment. We can apply the same formal strategy to any looped quantum evolution, in particular to the time travel. The argument is in its essence a topological one and thus does not refer to any concrete geometry. It is shown that the resulting paradigm automatically removes logical inconsistencies associated with chronology protection, provided all input-output relations are given by unitary maps. Examples of elementary loops and a two-loop time machine illustrate the construction. In order to apply the formalism to quantum computation one has to describe multi-qubit systems interacting via CTC-based quantum gates. This is achieved by second quantization of loops. An example of a multiparticle system, with oscillators interacting via a time machine, is explicitly calculated. However, the resulting treatment of CTCs is not equivalent to the one proposed by Deutsch in his classic paper [1].},

Since these are extremely powerful complexity classes, which are not expected to be solvable in reality, this can be taken as evidence that these models for CTCs are pathological. This problem is closely related to the nonlinearity of this models, which also allows, for example, cloning quantum states, in the case of D-CTCs, or distinguishing nonorthogonal quantum states, in the case of P-CTCs. In contrast, the process matrix formalism allows one to model indefinite causal structures in a linear way, getting rid of these effects and raising the possibility that its computational power is rather tame. In this paper, we show that process matrices correspond to a linear particular case of P-CTCs, and therefore that its computational power is upperbounded by that of PP. We show, furthermore, a family of processes that can violate causal inequalities but nevertheless can be simulated by a causally ordered quantum circuit with only a constant overhead, showing that indefinite causality is not necessarily hard to simulate.},

	abstract = {There is now a significant body of results on quantum interactions with closed timelike curves (CTCs) in the quantum information literature, for both the Deutsch model of CTC interactions (D-CTCs) and the projective model (P-CTCs). As a consequence, there is a prima facie argument exploiting entanglement that CTC interactions would enable superluminal and, indeed, effectively instantaneous signaling. In cases of spacelike separation between the sender of a signal and the receiver, whether a receiver measures the local part of an entangled state or a disentangled state to access the signal can depend on the reference frame. We propose a consistency condition that gives priority to either an entangled perspective or a disentangled perspective in spacelike-separated scenarios. For D-CTC interactions, the consistency condition gives priority to frames of reference in which the state is disentangled, while for P-CTC interactions the condition selects the entangled state. Using the consistency condition, we show that there is a procedure that allows Alice to signal to Bob in the past via relayed superluminal communications between spacelike-separated Alice and Clio, and spacelike-separated Clio and Bob. This opens the door to time travel paradoxes in the classical domain. Ralph [T. C. Ralph, arXiv:1107.4675 [quant-ph].] first pointed this out for P-CTCs, but we show that Ralph's procedure for a “radio to the past” is flawed. Since both D-CTCs and P-CTCs allow classical information to be sent around a spacetime loop, it follows from a result by Aaronson and Watrous [S. Aaronson and J. Watrous, Proc. R. Soc. A 465, 631 (2009)] for CTC-enhanced classical computation that a quantum computer with access to P-CTCs would have the power of PSPACE, equivalent to a D-CTC-enhanced quantum computer.},

When spontaneous breaking of symmetry is considered, such wave-like solutions show how a mass term with the wrong sign and the nonlinearity give rise to a proper dispersion relation. These latter solutions do not change the sign maintaining the property of the selected value of the equilibrium state. Then, we use these solutions to obtain a quantum field theory for the case of a quartic massless field. We get the propagator from a first-order correction showing that is consistent in the limit of a very large coupling. The spectrum of a massless quartic scalar field theory is then provided.

A consequence is that the Green function method works for this nonlinear problem in the large coupling limit as in a linear theory. A numerical proof is given for this. With these results at hand, I built a strongly coupled quantum field theory for a λϕ4 interacting field computing the first order correction to the generating functional. Mass spectrum of the theory is obtained turning out to be that of a harmonic oscillator with no dependence on the dimensionality of space-time. The agreement with the Lehmann-Källen representation of the perturbation series is then shown at the first order.},

These solutions have the interesting property to provide massive waves even if one starts from a massless equation. We analyze them classically providing also exact solutions to the corresponding equations for the Green functions needed to completely solve them in a strong coupling limit. This is accomplished using a functional expansion into powers of the current. It is shown that the spontaneous breaking of the Z2 symmetry is due to the existence of a zero mode that persists also in the case of the Higgs mechanism. In this latter case, the zero mode seems to play a role similar to the Goldstone boson in the breaking of a continuous symmetry and so, it should be important at lower momenta as a long range excitation.},

For a renormalizable theory, unitarity at each order in perturbation theory follows from the corresponding Hermiticity of each term in the time-ordered product of interaction Hamiltonians. For more general spacetimes, one can still use the path integral to obtain a generalized Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction formula for S-matrix elements and the corresponding perturbative expansion. Unitarity imposes an infinite set of identities on the scattering amplitudes, which are the generalizations of the flat-spacetime Cutkosky rules. We find these explicitly to O(λ3) in a λϕ4 theory, and show how to find the relations to any order. For globally hyperbolic spacetimes the unitarity identities are satisfied [at least to O(λ3)] because of a single property of the configuration-space propagator that reflects the causal structure of the spacetime.},

They are the Lorentzian counterpart of spacetimes with no past boundary that appear in the Hartle-Hawking prescription for a wavefunction of the universe. One can always choose metrics for which these Lorentzian spacetimes have no closed timelike curves; time nonorientability is then their only causal pathology. Classically, such spacetimes are locally indistinguishable from their globally hyperbolic covering spaces, and the initial-value problem for classical fields is globally well defined.

However, the construction of a quantum field theory (QFT) is more problematic. One can define a family of local algebras on an atlas of globally hyperbolic subspacetimes. But one cannot extend a generic positive linear function from a single algebra to the collection of all local algebras without violating positivity. The difficulty can be overcome by restricting the size of neighbourhoods so that the union of any pair is time orientable. The structure of local algebras and states is then locally indistinguishable from that of QFT on a globally hyperbolic spacetime. But the theory allows too little information to fix the global evolution of a state, because correlations between field operators at a pair of points are defined only if a curve joining the points lies in a single neighbourhood.

One could hope that the difficulties are restrictions on the observables in a generalized sum-over-histories approach, but the conjecture remains unexplored.},

	abstract = {We prove two theorems which concern difficulties in the formulation of the quantum theory of a linear scalar field on a spacetime, , with a compactly generated Cauchy horizon. These theorems demonstrate the breakdown of the theory at certain base points of the Cauchy horizon, which are defined as ‘past terminal accumulation points’ of the horizon generators. Thus, the theorems may be interpreted as giving support to Hawking's ‘Chronology Protection Conjecture’, according to which the laws of physics prevent one from manufacturing a ’time machine‘. Specifically, we prove:

Theorem 1. There is no extension to of the usual field algebra on the initial globally hyperbolic region which satisfies the condition of F-locality at any base point. In other words, any extension of the field algebra must, in any globally hyperbolic neighbourhood of any base point, differ from the algebra one would define on that neighbourhood according to the rules for globally hyperbolic spacetimes.

Theorem 2. The two-point distribution for any Hadamard state defined on the initial globally hyperbolic region must (when extended to a distributional bisolution of the covariant Klein-Gordon equation on the full spacetime) be singular at every base point x in the sense that the difference between this two point distribution and a local Hadamard distribution cannot be given by a bounded function in any neighbourhood (in M × M) of (x,x).

In consequence of Theorem 2, quantities such as the renormalized expectation value of φ2 or of the stress-energy tensor are necessarily ill-defined or singular at any base point.

The proof of these theorems relies on the ‘Propagation of Singularities’ theorems of Duistermaat and Hörmander.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that an advanced civilization might have the technology to warp spacetime so that closed timelike curves would appear, allowing travel into the past. This paper examines this possibility in the case that the causality violations appear in a finite region of spacetime without curvature singularities. There will be a Cauchy horizon that is compactly generated and that in general contains one or more closed null geodesics which will be incomplete. One can define geometrical quantities that measure the Lorentz boost and area increase on going round these closed null geodesics. If the causality violation developed from a noncompact initial surface, the averaged weak energy condition must be violated on the Cauchy horizon. This shows that one cannot create closed timelike curves with finite lengths of cosmic string. Even if violations of the weak energy condition are allowed by quantum theory, the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor would get very large if timelike curves become almost closed. It seems the back reaction would prevent closed timelike curves from appearing. These results strongly support the chronology protection conjecture: The laws of physics do not allow the appearance of closed timelike curves.},

In particular we argue that the theorem proved by Kay, Radzikowski, and Wald to the effect that time machines with compactly generated Cauchy horizons are incompatible with the F-locality condition actually does not support the “chronology protection conjecture,” but rather testifies that the F-locality condition must be modified or abandoned. We also show that this condition imposes a severe restriction on the geometry of the world (it is just this restriction that comes into conflict with the existence of a time machine), which does not follow from the above mentioned philosophical bias. So, one need not sacrifice the GH-equivalence principle to “amend” the F-locality condition. As an example we consider a particular modification, the “MF-locality condition.” The theory obtained by replacing the F-locality condition with the MF-locality condition possesses a few attractive features. One of them is that it is consistent with both locality and the existence of time machines.},

Quantum effects, known to be important in regions of large spacetime curvature, are found to also be important in these universes, where the curvature may be arbitrarily small or even zero. The vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor for a conformal scalar field is calculated on a flat archetype of the Taub-NUT-type universes, the Misner universe (flat Kasner spacetime with S1×R3 topology). The vacuum stress energy diverges at the singularity and on its associated Cauchy horizons.

	abstract = {We examine quantum field theory in spacetimes that are time nonorientable but have no other causal pathology. These are Lorentzian universes from nothing, spacetimes with a single spacelike boundary that nevertheless have a smooth Lorentzian metric. A time-nonorientable, spacelike hypersurface serves as a generalized Cauchy surface, a surface on which freely specified initial data for wave equations have unique global time evolutions. A simple example is antipodally identified de Sitter space. Classically, such spacetimes are locally indistinguishable from their globally hyperbolic covering spaces. The construction of a quantum field theory is more problematic. Time nonorientability precludes the existence of a global algebra of obsevables, and hence of global states, regarded as positive linear functions on a global algebra. One can, however, define a family of local algebras on an atlas of globally hyperbolic subspacetimes, with overlap conditions on the intersections of neighborhoods. This family locally coincides with the family of algebras on a globally hyperbolic spacetime; and one can ask whether a sensible quantum field theory is obtained if one defines a state as an assignment of a positive linear function to every local algebra. We show, however, that the extension of a generic positive linear function from a single algebra to the collection of all local algebras violates positivity: one cannot find a colleciton of quantum states satisfying the physically appropriate overlap conditions. One can overcome this difficulty by artificially restricting the size of neighborhoods in a way that has no classical counterpart.

Neighborhoods in the atlas must be small enough that the union of any pair is time orientable. Correlations between field operators at a pair of points are then defined only if a curve joining the points lies in a single neighborhood. Any state on one neighborhood of an atlas can be extended to a collection of states on the atlas, and the structure of local algebras and states is thus locally indistinguishable from quantum field theory on a globally hyperbolic spacetime. But the artificiality of the size restriction on neighborhoods means that the structure is not a satisfactory global field theory. The structure is not unique, because there is no unique maximal atlas. The resulting theory allows less information than quantum field theory in a globally hyperbolic spacetime, because there are always sets of points in the spacetime for which no correlation function is defined. Finally, in showing that one can extend a local state to a collection of states, we use an antipodally symmetric state on the covering space, a state that would not yield a sensible state on the spacetime if all correlations could be measured.},

When a spacetime possesses nonchronal regions which cannot be foliated by spacelike surfaces, as in the case of spacetimes with closed timelike curves, a more general formulation of quantum mechanics is required. In such generalizations the transition matrix between alternatives on two spacelike surfaces lying in regions of spacetime where foliating families can be defined may be nonunitary if a nonchronal region lies between them. This paper describes a sum-over-histories generalized quantum mechanics whose probabilities consistently obey the rules of probability theory even in the presence of such nonunitarity. The usual notion of state on a spacelike surface is lost in this generalization. Anomalies such as nonconservation of energy or "Everett phones" that are exhibited by some generalizations of quantum mechanics are not found in this one. However, the generalization is acausal in the sense that the existence of nonchronal regions of spacetime in the future can affect the probabilities of alternatives today and signaling outside the light cone is possible. The detectability of nonunitary evolution and violations of causality in measurement situations are briefly considered.},

	abstract = {It has been shown elsewhere that in a classical spacetime with multiply connected space slices (wormhole spacetime), closed timelike curves can form generically. The boundary between an initial region of spacetime without closed timelike curves and a later region with them is a Cauchy horizon which can be stable against small classical perturbations. This paper investigates stability against vacuum fluctuations of a quantized field, by calculating the field’s renormalized stress-energy tensor near the Cauchy horizon. The calculation is restricted to a massless, conformally coupled scalar field, but it is argued that the results will be the same to within factors of order unity for other noninteracting quantum fields. The calculation is given in order of magnitude for any spacetime with closed timelike curves, and then a detailed calculation is given for a specific example of such a spacetime: one with a traversable wormhole whose mouths create closed timelike curves by their relative motions. The renormalized stress-energy tensor is found to diverge as one approaches the Cauchy horizon.

However, the divergence is extremely weak: so weak, that as seen in the rest frame of one of the wormhole mouths the vacuum polarization’s gravity distorts the spacetime metric near the mouth by only δgVPμν∼(lP/D)(lP/Δt), where Δt is the proper time until one reaches the Cauchy horizon and D is the distance between the two mouths when the Cauchy horizon forms. For a macroscopic wormhole with D∼1 m, δgVPμν has only grown to lP/D∼10−35 when one is within a Planck length of the horizon. Since the very concept of classical spacetime is normally thought to fail, and be replaced by the quantum foam of quantum gravity on scales Δt≲lP, the authors are led to conjecture that the vacuum-polarization divergence gets cut off by quantum gravity upon reaching the tiny size lP/D, and spacetime remains macroscopically smooth and classical and develops closed timelike curves without difficulty. Hawking, in response to this, has conjectured that the spacetime near the Cauchy horizon remains classical until DΔt (which in a certain sense is frame invariant) gets as small as ∼l2P, and correspondingly until δgVPμν∼1, and that, as a result, the vacuum-polarization divergence will prevent the formation of closed timelike curves. These two conjectures are discussed and contrasted. The attempt to test them might produce insight into candidate theories of quantum gravity.},

As a consequence, their information-processing capabilities are equivalent. We also describe a method for quantum computers to simulate Deutschian CTCs (but with a reasonable overhead only in some cases). In cases for which the overhead is reasonable, it might be possible to perform the simulation in a table-top experiment. This approach has the benefit of resolving some ambiguities associated with the equivalent circuit model of Ralph et al.

The prescription is defined in terms of a first-order operator acting on a different Hilbert space from that used in the static prescription. It preserves the important properties of the earlier prescription: the formal solution agrees with the Cauchy evolution within the domain of dependence, and smooth data of compact support always give rise to smooth solutions. In the static case, the first-order formalism agrees with the second-order formalism (using specifically the Friedrichs extension). Applications to field quantization are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The mathematical formalism for linear quantum field theory on curved spacetime depends in an essential way on the assumption of global hyperbolicity. Physically, what lie at the foundation of any formalism for quantization in curved spacetime are the canonical commutation relations, imposed on the field operators evaluated at a global Cauchy surface. In the algebraic formulation of linear quantum field theory, the canonical commutation relations are restated in terms of a well-defined symplectic structure on the space of smooth solutions, and the local field algebra is constructed as the Weyl algebra associated to this symplectic vector space. When spacetime is not globally hyperbolic, e.g. when it contains naked singularities or closed time-like curves, a global Cauchy surface does not exist, and there is no obvious way to formulate the canonical commutation relations, hence no obvious way to construct the field algebra. In a paper which appears elsewhere in this journal, we report on a generalization of the algebraic framework for quantum field theory to arbitrary topological spaces which do not necessarily have a spacetime metric defined on them at the outset. Taking this generalization as a starting point, in this paper we give a prescription for constructing the field algebra of a (massless or massive) Klein--Gordon field on an arbitrary background spacetime. When spacetime is globally hyperbolic, the theory defined by our construction coincides with the ordinary Klein--Gordon field theory on a globally hyperbolic background. We explore some basic features of our generalized Klein--Gordon theory on arbitrary spacetimes, and study its specific properties on simple examples of non-globally-hyperbolic backgrounds that contain closed time-like curves or naked singularities.},

By simulating the equation of state of a perfect fluid with a real scalar field, quantum wormholes are also found when the strong energy condition is violated, although generally not AE. The non-AE solutions are interpreted as excited states of the quantum wormhole spectrum.

Our results give support to the claim of HP that quantum wormhole solutions are a fairly general property of the WDW equation for various matter sources. Matter sources giving quantum wormholes could now include those expected in low energy effective string theory: a dilaton scalar field with exponential potential. This is unlike the classical case where such matter sources do not allow wormhole solutions.

	abstract = {One out of many emerging implications from solutions of Einstein's general relativity equations are closed timelike curves (CTCs), which are trajectories through space-time that allow for time travel to the past without exceeding the speed of light. Two main quantum models of computation with the use of CTCs were introduced by Deutsch (D-CTC) and by Bennett and Schumacher (P-CTC). Unlike the classical theory in which CTCs lead to logical paradoxes, the quantum D-CTC model provides a solution that is logically consistent due to the self-consistency condition imposed on the evolving system, whereas the quantum P-CTC model chooses such a solution through postselection. Both models are nonequivalent and imply nonstandard phenomena in the field of quantum computation and quantum mechanics. In this paper, we study the implications of these two models on the second law of thermodynamics—the fundamental principle which states that in an isolated system the entropy never decreases. In particular, we construct CTC-based quantum circuits which lead to a decrease in entropy.},

	abstract = {In the context of a linear model (the covariant Klein Gordon equation) we review the mathematical and conceptual framework of quantum field theory on globally hyperbolic spacetimes, and address the question of what it might mean to quantize a field on a non globally hyperbolic spacetime. Our discussion centres on the notion of F-locality which we introduce and which asserts there is a net of local algebras such that every neighbourhood of every point contains a globally hyperbolic subneighbourhood of that point for which the field algebra coincides with the algebra one would obtain were one to regard the subneighbourhood as a spacetime in its own right and quantize — with some choice of time-orientation — according to the standard rules for quantum field theory on globally hyperbolic spacetimes. We show that F-locality is a property of the standard field algebra construction for globally hyperbolic spacetimes, and argue that it (or something similar) should be imposed as a condition on any field algebra construction for non globally hyperbolic spacetimes. We call a spacetime for which there exists a field algebra satisfying F-locality F-quantum compatible and argue that a spacetime which did not satisfy something similar to this condition could not arise as an approximate classical description of a state of quantum gravity and would hence be ruled out physically. We show that all F-quantum compatible spacetimes are time orientable. We also raise the issue of whether chronology violating spacetimes can be F-quantum compatible, giving a special model — a massless field theory on the “four dimensional spacelike cylinder” — which is F-quantum compatible, and a (two dimensional) model — a massless field theory on Misner space — which is not. We discuss the possible relevance of this latter result to Hawking’s recent Chronology Protection Conjecture.},

This raises the question of whether this could create a grandfather paradox, in which the observer interacts in such a way to prevent their own time travel. Previous research has proposed a framework for deterministic, reversible, dynamics compatible with non-trivial time travel, where observers in distinct regions of spacetime can perform arbitrary local operations with no contradiction arising. However, only scenarios with up to three regions have been fully characterised, revealing only one type of process where the observers can verify to both be in the past and future of each other. Here we extend this characterisation to an arbitrary number of regions and find that there exist several inequivalent processes that can only arise due to non-trivial time travel. This supports the view that complex dynamics is possible in the presence of CTCs, compatible with free choice of local operations and free of inconsistencies.},

A consequence of CTCs is the failure of determinism, even for classical systems: one initial condition can result in multiple evolutions. Here we introduce a quantum formulation of a classic example, where a billiard ball can travel along two possible trajectories: one unperturbed and one, along a CTC, where it collides with its past self. Our model includes a vacuum state, allowing the ball to be present or absent on each trajectory, and a clock, which provides an operational way to distinguish the trajectories. We apply the two foremost quantum theories of CTCs to our model: Deutsch's model (D-CTCs) and postselected teleportation (P-CTCs). We find that D-CTCs reproduce the classical solution multiplicity in the form of a mixed state, while P-CTCs predict an equal superposition of the two trajectories, supporting a conjecture by Friedman et al.

This question has received a great deal of attention in the physics literature, with attempts to prove no-go theorems based on classical general relativity and various hybrid theories serving as steps along the way towards quantum gravity. Despite the effort put into these no-go theorems, there is no widely accepted definition of a time machine. We explain the conundrum that must be faced in providing a satisfactory definition and propose a resolution. Roughly, we require that all extensions of the time machine region contain closed timelike curves; the actions of the time machine operator are then sufficiently “potent” to guarantee that closed timelike curves appear. We then review no-go theorems based on classical general relativity, semi-classical quantum gravity, quantum field theory on curved spacetime, and Euclidean quantum gravity. Our verdict on the question of our title is that no result of sufficient generality to underwrite a confident “yes” has been proven. Our review of the no-go results does, however, highlight several foundational problems at the intersection of general relativity and quantum physics that lend substance to the search for an answer.},

The resulting spacetime is topologically trivial, free of curvature singularities and is both time and space orientable; besides, the inner region enclosed by the smaller torus is flat and displays geodesic CTCs. Our model shares some similarities with the time machine of Ori and Soen but it has the advantage of a higher symmetry in the metric, allowing for the explicit computation of a class of geodesics. The most remarkable feature emerging from this computation is the presence of future-oriented timelike geodesics starting from a point in the outer Minkowskian region, moving to the inner spacetime region with CTCs, and then returning to the initial spatial position at an earlier time; this means that time travel to the past can be performed by free fall across our time machine. The amount of time travelled into the past is determined quantitatively; this amount can be made arbitrarily large keeping non-large the proper duration of the travel. An important drawback of the model is the violation of the classical energy conditions, a common feature of many time machines. Other problems emerge from our computations of the required (negative) energy densities and of the tidal accelerations; these are small only if the time machine is gigantic.},

	abstract = {We examine closed timelike curves (CTCs) and ‘effective’ superluminal travel in a spacetime containing naked line singularities, which we call ‘wires’. Each wire may be straight-line singularity or a ring singularity. The weak energy condition (WEC) is preserved in all well-defined regions of the spacetime. (The singularities themselves are not well-defined, so the WEC is undefined there, but it is never explicitly violated.) Parallel to the wire, ‘effective’ superluminal travel is possible, in that the wire may be used as a shortcut between distant regions of spacetime. Our purpose in presenting the superluminal aspects of the wire is to dispel the commonly held view that explicit WEC violation is necessary for effective superluminal travel, whereas in truth the strictures against superluminal travel are more complicated. We also demonstrate how the existence of such ‘wires’ could create CTCs. We present a model spacetime which contains two wires which are free to move relative to each other. This spacetime is asymptotically flat: it becomes a Minkowski spacetime a finite distance away from each of the wires. The CTCs under investigation do not need to enter the wires’ singularities, and can be confined to regions that are weak-field: this means that if these wires were physically possible, they would present causality problems even in nonsingular, energetically realistic regions of the spacetime. We conclude that the weak energy condition alone is not sufficient to prevent superluminal travel in asymptotically flat spacetimes.},

Just pop back in the timestream and stop it before it starts. But for those of us not lucky enough to live in a science-fictional universe, are these ideas merely flights of fancy—or could it really be possible to travel through time or take shortcuts between stars?

Cutting-edge physics may not be able to answer those questions yet, but it does offer up some tantalizing possibilities. In Time Travel and Warp Drives, Allen Everett and Thomas A. Roman take readers on a clear, concise tour of our current understanding of the nature of time and space—and whether or not we might be able to bend them to our will. Using no math beyond high school algebra, the authors lay out an approachable explanation of Einstein's special relativity, then move through the fundamental differences between traveling forward and backward in time and the surprising theoretical connection between going back in time and traveling faster than the speed of light. They survey a variety of possible time machines and warp drives, including wormholes and warp bubbles, and, in a dizzyingly creative chapter, imagine the paradoxes that could plague a world where time travel was possible—killing your own grandfather is only one of them!

Written with a light touch and an irrepressible love of the fun of sci-fi scenarios—but firmly rooted in the most up-to-date science, Time Travel and Warp Drives will be a delightful discovery for any science buff or armchair chrononaut.

	abstract = {Prompted by various questions regarding the putative existence, stability, and chronological properties of traversable wormholes, a number of authors have presented calculations of the renormalized stress-energy tensor in wormhole spacetimes. In particular, the use of point-splitting techniques leads to expressions that contain the van Vleck determinant as a common prefactor. Recent technical advances permit one to undertake extensive computations of the van Vleck determinant in traversable wormhole spacetimes, at least in the short-throat flat-space approximation. This paper presents several such computations for various model spacetimes. Implications with regard to Hawking’s chronology protection conjecture are discussed. In particular, any attempt to transform a single isolated wormhole into a time machine results in large vacuum polarization effects. These vacuum polarization effects are sufficient to disrupt the internal structure of the wormhole long before the onset of Planck scale physics, and before the onset of time travel. Thus for isolated wormholes, vacuum polarization effects are sufficient to enforce Hawking’s chronology protection conjecture. On the other hand, it is possible to conceive of a putative time machine built out of two or more wormholes, each of which taken in isolation is not itself a time machine. Such ‘‘Roman configurations’’ are much more subtle to analyze. For ‘‘reasonable’’ configurations (traversable by humans) the vacuum polarization effects in such multiple wormhole putative time machines become large long before the onset of Planck scale physics. The disruption scale for would-be ‘‘traversable time machines’’ is well above the Planck length. On the other hand, for some particularly bizarre configurations (not traversable by humans) the vacuum polarization effects can be arranged to be arbitrarily small at the onset of Planck scale physics. This indicates that the disruption scale has been pushed down into the Planck slope. This is mildly disturbing. Ultimately, for these bizarre configurations, questions regarding the truth or falsity of Hawking’s chronology protection can only be addressed by entering the uncharted wastelands of full fledged quantum gravity.},

We demonstrate that a non-minimally coupled scalar field with a positive curvature coupling ξ{\textgreater}0 can easily violate all the standard energy conditions, up to and including the averaged null energy condition (ANEC). Indeed, this violation of the ANEC suggests the possible existence of traversable wormholes supported by non-minimally coupled scalars. To investigate this possibility we derive the classical solutions for gravity plus a general (arbitrary ξ) massless non-minimally coupled scalar field, restricting attention to the static and spherically symmetric configurations. Among these classical solutions we find an entire branch of traversable wormholes for every ξ{\textgreater}0. (This includes and generalizes the case of conformal coupling ξ = (1/6) we considered in 1999 Phys. Lett. B 466 127-34.) For these traversable wormholes to exist we demonstrate that the scalar field must reach trans-Planckian values somewhere in the geometry. We discuss how this can be accommodated within the current state of the art regarding scalar fields in modern theoretical physics. We emphasize that these scalar field theories, and the traversable wormhole solutions we derive, are compatible with all known experimental constraints from both particle physics and gravity.},

For an arbitrary static spacetime we shall define the wormhole throat in terms of a two-dimensional constant-time hypersurface of minimal area. (Zero trace for the extrinsic curvature plus a “flare-out” condition.) This enables us to severely constrain the geometry of spacetime at the wormhole throat and to derive generalized theorems regarding violations of the energy conditions, theorems that do not involve geodesic averaging but nevertheless apply to situations much more general than the spherically symmetric Morris-Thorne traversable wormhole. (For example, the null energy condition, when suitably weighted and integrated over the wormhole throat, must be violated.)

	abstract = {A simple special-relativistic derivation of the Sagnac effect, which reconciles the earlier general-relativistic and nonrelativistic derivations, is given. A distinction is made between the "classical Sagnac effect" and the "quantum Sagnac effect." A new group-theoretic derivation of these effects is also given. It is pointed out that there must exist a phase shift due to the Thomas precession in the interference of particles with intrinsic spin. The group-theoretic treatment also elucidates the connection between relativistic and nonrelativistic physics, on a classical and quantum level, with and without gravity. A formulation of the principle of equivalence, which is related to the Sagnac effect, is given in relativistic and nonrelativistic physics in terms of the respective invariance groups. New experiments are proposed to test the Sagnac effect in superfluid helium. The possible use of the general-relativistic Sagnac effect to measure the curvature tensor and in particular to detect gravitational waves is suggested.},

The simplest example of such a transformation is the classical switch of black boxes, where two input black boxes are arranged in two different orders conditionally on the value of a classical bit. The quantum version of this transformation—the quantum switch—produces an output circuit where the order of the connections is controlled by a quantum bit, which becomes entangled with the circuit structure. Simulating these transformations in a circuit with fixed causal structure requires either postselection or an extra query to the input black boxes.},

This paper shows that this assumption, although widespread and apparently trivial, leads to an anisotropy of the velocity of two light beams traveling in opposite directions along the rim of the disk, which in turn implies some recently pointed out paradoxical consequences undermining the self-consistency of the special theory of relativity (SRT). A correct application of the SRT solves the problem and recovers complete internal consistency for the theory. As an immediate consequence, it is shown that the Sagnac effect only depends on the nonhomogeneity of time of the platform and has nothing to do with any anisotropy of the speed of light along the rim of the disk, contrary to an incorrect but widely held idea.},

It remains an important subject for the understanding of such contemporary topics as inflationary cosmology, quantum gravity and superstring theory. This book provides, for mathematicians, an introduction to this field of physics in a language and from a viewpoint which such a reader should find congenial. Physicists should also gain from reading this book a sound grasp of various aspects of the theory, some of which have not been particularly emphasised in the existing review literature. The topics covered include normal-mode expansions for a general elliptic operator, Fock space, the Casimir effect, the 'Klein' paradox, particle definition and particle creation in expanding universes, asymptotic expansion of Green's functions and heat kernels, and renormalisation of the stress tensor. The style is pedagogic rather than formal; some knowledge of general relativity and differential geometry is assumed, but the author does supply background material on functional analysis and quantum field theory as required. The book arose from a course taught to graduate students and could be used for self-study or for advanced courses in relativity and quantum field theory.},

	abstract = {The “warp drive” metric recently presented by Alcubierre has the problem that an observer at the center of the warp bubble is causally separated from the outer edge of the bubble wall. Hence such an observer can neither create a warp bubble on demand nor control one once it has been created. In addition, such a bubble requires negative energy densities. One might hope that elimination of the first problem might ameliorate the second as well. We analyze and generalize a metric, originally proposed by Krasnikov for two spacetime dimensions, which does not suffer from the first difficulty. As a consequence, the Krasnikov metric has the interesting property that, although the time for a one-way trip to a distant star cannot be shortened, the time for a round trip, as measured by clocks on Earth, can be made arbitrarily short. In our four-dimensional extension of this metric, a “tube” is constructed along the path of an outbound spaceship, which connects the Earth and the star. Inside the tube spacetime is flat, but the light cones are opened out so as to allow superluminal travel in one direction. We show that, although a single Krasnikov tube does not involve closed timelike curves, a time machine can be constructed with a system of two nonoverlapping tubes. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that Krasnikov tubes, like warp bubbles and traversable wormholes, also involve unphysically thin layers of negative energy density, as well as large total negative energies, and, therefore, probably cannot be realized in practice.},

The inclusion of such a bubble in a spacetime will render the background spacetime non-orientable, generating additional consistency constraints for formulations of the initial value problem.

In this paper, we build a framework for probabilistic theories with non-fixed causal structure. This combines the radical elements of general relativity and quantum theory. We adopt an operational methodology for the purposes of theory construction (though without committing to operationalism as a fundamental philosophy). The key idea in the construction is physical compression. A physical theory relates quantities. Thus, if we specify a sufficiently large set of quantities (this is the compressed set), we can calculate all the others. We apply three levels of physical compression. First, we apply it locally to quantities (actually probabilities) that might be measured in a particular region of spacetime. Then we consider composite regions. We find that there is a second level of physical compression for a composite region over and above the first level physical compression for the component regions. Each application of first and second level physical compression is quantified by a matrix. We find that these matrices themselves are related by the physical theory and can therefore be subject to compression. This is the third level of physical compression. The third level of physical compression gives rise to a new mathematical object which we call the causaloid. From the causaloid for a particular physical theory we can calculate everything the physical theory can calculate. This approach allows us to set up a framework for calculating probabilistic correlations in data without imposing a fixed causal structure (such as a background time). We show how to put quantum theory in this framework (thus providing a new formulation of this theory). We indicate how general relativity might be put into this framework and how the framework might be used to construct a theory of quantum gravity.},

	abstract = {Quantum theory is a probabilistic theory with fixed causal structure. General relativity is a deterministic theory but where the causal structure is dynamic. It is reasonable to expect that quantum gravity will be a probabilistic theory with dynamic causal structure. The purpose of this paper is to present a framework for such a probability calculus. We define an operational notion of space-time, this being composed of elementary regions. Central to this formalism is an object we call the causaloid. This object captures information about causal structure implicit in the data by quantifying the way in which the number of measurements required to establish a state for a composite region is reduced when there is a causal connection between the component regions. This formalism puts all elementary regions on an equal footing. It does not require that we impose fixed causal structure. In particular, it is not necessary to assume the existence of a background time. Remarkably, given the causaloid, we can calculate all relevant probabilities and so the causaloid is sufficient to specify the predictive aspect of a physical theory. We show how certain causaloids can be represented by suggestive diagrams and we show how to represent both classical probability theory and quantum theory by a causaloid. We do not give a causaloid formulation for general relativity though we speculate that this is possible. The work presented here suggests a research program aimed at finding a theory of quantum gravity. The idea is to use the causaloid formalism along with principles taken from the two theories to marry the dynamic causal structure of general relativity with the probabilistic structure of quantum theory.},

In quantum theory events unfold in a fixed order while in general relativity temporal order is influenced by the distribution of matter. When matter requires a quantum description, temporal order is expected to become non-classical—a scenario beyond the scope of current theories. Here we provide a direct description of such a scenario. We consider a thought experiment with a massive body in a spatial superposition and show how it leads to entanglement of temporal orders between time-like events. This entanglement enables accomplishing a task, violation of a Bell inequality, that is impossible under local classical temporal order; it means that temporal order cannot be described by any pre-defined local variables. A classical notion of a causal structure is therefore untenable in any framework compatible with the basic principles of quantum mechanics and classical general relativity.},

It will be shown here that these are spurious worries, and that denial of SI simply implies nonlocal correlation between spacelike degrees of freedom. Lorentz-invariant theories in which SI does not hold are easily constructed: two are exhibited here.

Some writers have argued that time-symmetry counts in favour of such a view, in the sense that retrocausality would be a natural consequence of a truly time-symmetric theory of the quantum world. Critics object that there is complete time-symmetry in classical physics, and yet no apparent retrocausality. Why should the quantum world be any different? This note throws some new light on these matters. I call attention to a respect in which quantum mechanics is different, under some assumptions about quantum ontology. Under these assumptions, the combination of time-symmetry without retrocausality is unavailable in quantum mechanics, for reasons intimately connected with the differences between classical and quantum physics (especially the role of discreteness in the latter). Not all interpretations of quantum mechanics share these assumptions, however, and in those that do not, time-symmetry does not entail retrocausality.},

Costa de Beauregard proposed that such correlations can be explained without action at a distance, so long as the influence takes a zigzag path, via the intersecting past lightcones of the events in question. Costa de Beauregard’s proposal is related to what has come to be called the retrocausal loophole in Bell’s Theorem, but—like that loophole—it receives little attention, and remains poorly understood. Here we propose a new way to explain and motivate the idea. We exploit some simple symmetries to show how Costa de Beauregard’s zigzag needs to work, to explain the correlations at the core of Bell’s Theorem. As a bonus, the explanation shows how entanglement might be a much simpler matter than the orthodox view assumes—not a puzzling feature of quantum reality itself, but an entirely unpuzzling feature of our knowledge of reality, once zigzags are in play.},

It is interesting to ask how this is possible, in the light of Bell's Theorem. We investigate this question, and present two options. Either (i) the new cases are nonlocal too, in which case AAD is more widespread in QM than has previously been appreciated (and does not depend on entanglement, as usually construed); or (ii) the means of avoiding AAD in the new cases extends in a natural way to EPRB, removing AAD in these cases too. There is a third option, viz., that the new cases are strongly disanalogous to EPRB. But this option requires an argument, so far missing, that the physical world breaks the symmetries which otherwise support the analogy. In the absence of such an argument, the orthodox combination of views—action-at-a-distance in EPRB, but local causality in its timelike analogue—is less well established than it is usually assumed to be.},

By using a simple model with no dynamical laws, it becomes evident that this behavior is actually quite natural when analyzed “all-at-once” (as in classical action principles). From this perspective, traditional quantum states would represent incomplete information about possible spacetime histories, conditional on the future measurement geometry. Without dynamical laws imposing additional restrictions, those histories can have a classical probability distribution, where exactly one history can be said to represent an underlying reality.},

We analyze a simple closed causal loop ensuing from the interaction between two systems with opposing thermodynamic time arrows, such that each system can forecast future events for the other. The loop is avoided by the fact that the choice to abort an event thus forecasted leads to the destruction of the forecaster's past. Physical law therefore enables prophecy of future events only as long as this prophecy is not revealed to a free agent who can otherwise render it false. This resolution is demonstrated on an earlier finding derived from the two-state vector formalism, where a weak measurement's outcome anticipates a future choice, yet this anticipation becomes apparent only after the choice has been actually made. To quantify this assertion, weak information is described in terms of Fisher information. We conclude that an already existing future does not exclude free will nor invoke causal paradoxes. On the quantum level, particles can be thought of as weakly interacting according to their past and future states, but causality remains intact as long as the future is masked by quantum indeterminism.Quanta 2016; 5: 53–60.},

Here, we show that this assumption can be replaced by a different assumption, called λ-mediation, that plausibly holds independently of the status of the quantum state. We also reformulate the other assumptions behind the argument to place them in a more general framework and pin down the notion of time symmetry involved more precisely. We show that our assumptions imply a timelike analogue of Bell's local causality criterion and, in doing so, give a new interpretation of timelike violations of Bell inequalities.

However, no physical implementation of such resources is known. Here we show that a recently demonstrated resource for quantum computation—the quantum switch—is a genuine example of ‘indefinite causal order’.

	abstract = {The idea that events are equipped with a partial causal order is central to our understanding of physics in the tested regimes: given two pointlike events A and B, either A is in the causal past of B, B is in the causal past of A, or A and B are space-like separated. Operationally, the meaning of these order relations corresponds to constraints on the possible correlations between experiments performed in the vicinities of the respective events: if A is in the causal past of B, an experimenter at A could signal to an experimenter at B but not the other way around, while if A and B are space-like separated, no signaling is possible in either direction. In the context of a concrete physical theory, the correlations compatible with a given causal configuration may obey further constraints. For instance, space-like correlations in quantum mechanics arise from local measurements on joint quantum states, while time-like correlations are established via quantum channels. Similarly to other variables, however, the causal order of a set of events could be random, and little is understood about the constraints that causality implies in this case. A main difficulty concerns the fact that the order of events can now generally depend on the operations performed at the locations of these events, since, for instance, an operation at A could influence the order in which B and C occur in A’s future. So far, no formal theory of causality compatible with such dynamical causal order has been developed. Apart from being of fundamental interest in the context of inferring causal relations, such a theory is imperative for understanding recent suggestions that the causal order of events in quantum mechanics can be indefinite. Here, we develop such a theory in the general multipartite case. Starting from a background-independent definition of causality, we derive an iteratively formulated canonical decomposition of multipartite causal correlations. For a fixed number of settings and outcomes for each party, these correlations form a polytope whose facets define causal inequalities. The case of quantum correlations in this paradigm is captured by the process matrix formalism. We investigate the link between causality and the closely related notion of causal separability of quantum processes, which we here define rigorously in analogy with the link between Bell locality and separability of quantum states. We show that causality and causal separability are not equivalent in general by giving an example of a physically admissible tripartite quantum process that is causal but not causally separable. We also show that there are causally separable quantum processes that become non-causal if extended by supplying the parties with entangled ancillas. This motivates the concepts of extensibly causal and extensibly causally separable (ECS) processes, for which the respective property remains invariant under extension. We characterize the class of ECS quantum processes in the tripartite case via simple conditions on the form of the process matrix. We show that the processes realizable by classically controlled quantum circuits are ECS and conjecture that the reverse also holds.},

However, the possible interplay between quantum mechanics and general relativity may require a revision of this paradigm. The process matrix framework keeps the validity of quantum physics locally but does not assume the existence of a global causal order. It allows to describe causal structures corresponding to a quantum superposition of ‘A is before B’ and ‘B is before A’. So far, the framework has been developed only for finite-dimensional systems, and a straightforward generalization to infinite dimensions leads to singularities. Such generalization is necessary for continuous-variable systems and is a prerequisite for quantum fields on indefinite causal structures. Here we develop the process-matrix framework for continuous-variable systems. We encounter and solve the problems of singularities. Moreover, we study an example of a process in infinite dimensions, and we derive correlations exhibiting intereference due to processes in which A is before B and B is before A.},

In this paper we present an alternative perspective and derive a unified probability rule that subsumes both the Born rule and the collapse rule. We show that this more fundamental probability rule can provide a rigorous foundation for informational, or ‘knowledge-based’, interpretations of quantum theory.

The assumption of a fixed causal order between a set of parties, together with free randomness, implies device-independent inequalities—just as the assumption of locality does. It is known that local validity of quantum theory is consistent with violating such inequalities. Moreover, for three parties or more, even the (stronger) assumption of local classical probability theory plus logical consistency allows for violating causal inequalities. Here, we show that a classical environment (with which the parties interact), possibly containing loops, is logically consistent if and only if whatever the involved parties do, there is exactly one fixed-point, the latter being representable as a mixture of deterministic fixed-points. We further show that the non-causal view allows for a model of computation strictly more powerful than computation in a world of fixed causal orders.},

	abstract = {Feynman's sum-over-histories formulation of quantum mechanics is reviewed as an independent statement of quantum theory in spacetime form. It is different from the usual Schrödinger-Heisenberg formulation that utilizes states on spacelike surfaces because it assigns probabilities to different sets of alternatives. In a sum-over-histories formulation, alternatives at definite moments of time are more restricted than in usual quantum mechanics because they refer only to the coördinates in terms of which the histories are defined. However, in the context of the quantum mechanics of closed systems, sum-over-histories quantum mechanics can be generalized to deal with spacetime alternatives that are not “at definite moments of time”. An example in field theory is the set of alternative ranges of values of a field averaged over a spacetime region. An example in particle mechanics is the set of the alternatives defined by whether a particle never crosses a fixed spacetime region or crosses it at least once. The general notion of a set of spacetime alternatives is a partition (coarse-graining) of the histories into an exhaustive set of exclusive classes. With this generalization the sum-over-histories formulation can be said to be in fully spacetime form with dynamics represented by path integrals over spacetime histories and alternatives defined as spacetime partitions of these histories. When restricted to alternatives at definite moments of times this generalization is equivalent to Schrödinger-Heisenberg quantum mechanics. However, the quantum mechanics of more general spacetime alternatives does not have an equivalent Schrödinger-Heisenberg formulation. We suggest that, in the quantum theory of gravity, the general notion of “observable” is supplied by diffeomorphism invariant partitions of spacetime metrics and matter field configurations. By generalizing the usual alternatives so as to put quantum theory in fully spacetime form we may be led to a covariant generalized quantum mechanics of spacetime free from the problem of time.},

An axiomatic approach is taken. We list five conditions which the renormalized stress-energy operatorTμvshould satisfy in order to give a reasonable semiclassical theory.

An error is pointed out in the work of Adler, Lieberman, and Ng: The "locally determined" piece GL(x, x′) and "boundary-condition-dependent" piece GB(x, x′) of G(x, x′) do not separately satisfy the wave equation in x′, as required in their proof of the conservation of the boundary-condition-dependent contribution to Tμν. This error affects the point-separation renormalization prescription given in my previous paper describing an axiomatic approach to stress-energy renormalization. It is now seen that this prescription yields a stress-energy tensor whose divergence is not zero but is the gradient of a local curvature term. However, this deficiency can be corrected by subtracting off this local curvature term times the metric tensor; as a direct consequence the trace of Tμν becomes nonvanishing. Given this result it is shown that any prescription for renormalizing Tμν which is consistent with conservation (axiom 3), causality (axiom 4), and agreement with the formal expression for the matrix element between orthogonal states (axiom 1) must yield precisely this trace, modulo the trace of a conserved local curvature term. Hence, for consistency with the first four axioms and dimensional considerations, we find that the trace of the stress tensor of the conformally invariant scalar field must be Tμμ=(2880π2)−1(CαβδγCαβδγ+RαβRαβ=13R2) plus an arbitrary constant times ∇α∇αR. This confirms previous work of a number of authors on the existence of trace anomalies. For consistency with axiom 5 (no "local curvature terms containing third or higher derivatives of the matric"), the coefficient of the ∇α∇αR term must be zero. However, it is argued that if the expectation value G(x, x′) is of the Hadamard form in the massless case, as assumed in defining the point-separation renormalization prescription, then axiom 5 cannot be satisfied and, indeed, a completely unambiguous prescription for Tμν cannot be given without introducing a length scale.},

In his presentation, Wald disentangles essential features of the theory from inessential ones (such as a particle interpretation) and clarifies relationships between various approaches to the formulation of the theory. He also provides a comprehensive, up-to-date account of the Unruh effect, the Hawking effect, and some of its ramifications. In particular, the subject of black hole thermodynamics, which remains an active area of research, is treated in depth.This book will be accessible to students and researchers who have had introductory courses in general relativity and quantum field theory, and will be of interest to scientists in general relativity and related fields.},

	abstract = {Past studies of the billiard-ball paradox, a problem involving an object that travels back in time along a closed timelike curve (CTC), typically concern themselves with entirely classical histories, whereby any trajectorial effects associated with quantum mechanics cannot manifest. Here we develop a quantum version of the paradox, wherein a (semiclassical) wave packet evolves through a region containing a wormhole time machine. This is accomplished by mapping all relevant paths on to a quantum circuit, in which the distinction of the various paths is facilitated by representing the billiard particle with a clock state. For this model, we find that Deutsch's prescription (D-CTCs) provides self-consistent solutions in the form of a mixed state composed of terms which represent every possible configuration of the particle’s evolution through the circuit. In the equivalent circuit picture (ECP), this reduces to a binomial distribution in the number of loops of time machine. The postselected teleportation prescription (P-CTCs) on the other hand predicts a pure-state solution in which the loop counts have binomial coefficient weights. We then discuss the model in the continuum limit, with a particular focus on the various methods one may employ in order to guarantee convergence in the average number of clock evolutions. Specifically, for D-CTCs, we find that it is necessary to regularise the theory’s parameters, while P-CTCs alternatively require more contrived modification.},

	abstract = {This paper starts with a brief review of the topic of strong and weak pre- and post-selected (PPS) quantum measurements, as well as weak values, and afterwards presents original work. In particular, we develop a nonperturbative theory of weak PPS measurements of an arbitrary system with an arbitrary meter, for arbitrary initial states of the system and the meter. New and simple analytical formulas are obtained for the average and the distribution of the meter pointer variable. These formulas hold to all orders in the weak value. In the case of a mixed preselected state, in addition to the standard weak value, an associated weak value is required to describe weak PPS measurements. In the linear regime, the theory provides the generalized Aharonov–Albert–Vaidman formula. Moreover, we reveal two new regimes of weak PPS measurements: the strongly-nonlinear regime and the inverted region (the regime with a very large weak value), where the system-dependent contribution to the pointer deflection decreases with increasing the measurement strength. The optimal conditions for weak PPS measurements are obtained in the strongly-nonlinear regime, where the magnitude of the average pointer deflection is equal or close to the maximum. This maximum is independent of the measurement strength, being typically of the order of the pointer uncertainty. In the optimal regime, the small parameter of the theory is comparable to the overlap of the pre- and post-selected states. We show that the amplification coefficient in the weak PPS measurements is generally a product of two qualitatively different factors. The effects of the free system and meter Hamiltonians are discussed. We also estimate the size of the ensemble required for a measurement and identify optimal and efficient meters for weak measurements. Exact solutions are obtained for a certain class of the measured observables. These solutions are used for numerical calculations, the results of which agree with the theory. Moreover, the theory is extended to allow for a completely general post-selection measurement. We also discuss time-symmetry properties of PPS measurements of any strength and the relation between PPS and standard (not post-selected) measurements.},

	abstract = {The quantum theory of measurement has been with us since quantum mechanics was invented. It has recently been invigorated, partly due to the increasing interest in quantum information science. In this partly pedagogical review I attempt to give a self-contained overview of non-relativistic quantum theory of measurement expressed in density matrix formalism. I will not dwell on the applications in quantum information theory; it is well covered by several books in that field. The focus is instead on applications to the theory of weak measurement, as developed by Aharonov and collaborators. Their development of weak measurement combined with what they call post-selection - judiciously choosing not only the initial state of a system (pre-selection) but also its final state - has received much attention recently. Not the least has it opened up new, fruitful experimental vistas, like novel approaches to amplification. But the approach has also attached to it some air of mystery. I will attempt to demystify it by showing that (almost) all results can be derived in a straight-forward way from conventional quantum mechanics. Among other things, I develop the formalism not only to first order but also to second order in the weak interaction responsible for the measurement. I apply it to the so called Leggett-Garg inequalities, also known as Bell inequalities in time. I also give an outline, even if rough, of some of the ingenious experiments that the work by Aharonov and collaborators has inspired. As an application of weak measurement, not related to the approach by Aharonov and collaborators, the formalism also allows me to derive the master equation for the density matrix of an open system in interaction with an environment. An issue that remains in the weak measurement plus post-selection approach is the interpretation of the so called weak value of an observable. Is it a bona fide property of the system considered? I have no definite answer to this question; I shall only exhibit the consequences of the proposed interpretation.Quanta 2013; 2: 18–49.},

Further, its application to three distinct experimental techniques is reviewed. First, as a large interaction parameter it can amplify small signals above technical background noise. Second, as a measurable complex value it enables novel techniques for direct quantum state and geometric phase determination. Third, as a conditioned average of generalized observable eigenvalues it provides a measurable window into nonclassical features of quantum mechanics. In this selective review, a single experimental configuration to discuss and clarify each of these applications is used.},

We provide a definition of the state vector in terms of measurable quantities by decomposing these column operators into observables. The technique we propose renders very-large-scale quantum states significantly more accessible in the laboratory, as we demonstrate by experimentally characterizing a 100,000-dimensional entangled state.

One severe drawback of all currently available quantum metrology techniques is the need for a time-consuming characterization process, which scales very unfavorably with the dimensionality of the quantum system. Here we demonstrate a technique that directly measures a million-dimensional photonic spatial state with a single setting of the measurement apparatus. Through the arrangement of a weak measurement of momentum and parallel strong measurements of position, the complex values of the entire photon state vector become measurable directly. The dimension of our measured state is approximately four orders of magnitude larger than previously measured. Our work opens up a practical route for characterizing high-dimensional quantum systems in real time.

Using this method, we experimentally measure a 192-dimensional state with a fidelity of 90\% using only 25 percent of the total required measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate the measurement of a 19 200-dimensional state, a task that would require an unfeasibly large acquiring time with the standard direct measurement technique.},

	abstract = {The measurement of a quantum state poses a unique challenge for experimentalists. Recently, the technique of ‘direct measurement’ was proposed for characterizing a quantum state in situ through sequential weak and strong measurements. While this method has been used for measuring polarization states, its real potential lies in the measurement of states with a large dimensionality. Here we show the practical direct measurement of a high-dimensional state vector in the discrete basis of orbital angular momentum. Through weak measurements of orbital angular momentum and strong measurements of angular position, we measure the complex probability amplitudes of a pure state with a dimensionality, d=27. Further, we use our method to directly observe the relationship between rotations of a state vector and the relative phase between its orbital-angular-momentum components. Our technique has important applications in high-dimensional classical and quantum information systems and can be extended to characterize other types of large quantum states.},

The first two measurements are made weak to minimize the disturbance they cause to the state, while the final measurement is strong. We perform this joint measurement on polarized photons in pure and mixed states to directly measure their density matrix. The weak measurements are achieved using two walk-off crystals, each inducing a polarization-dependent spatial shift that couples the spatial and polarization degrees of freedom of the photons. This direct measurement method provides an operational meaning to the density matrix and promises to be especially useful for large dimensional states.},

The velocity of a point x in configuration space is defined as the standard probability current j(x) divided by the probability density P(x). However, this ‘standard’ j is in fact only one of infinitely many that transform correctly and satisfy . In this paper, I show that a particular j is singled out if one requires that j be determined experimentally as a weak value, using a technique that would make sense to a physicist with no knowledge of QM. This ‘naively observable’ j seems the most natural way to define j operationally. Moreover, I show that this operationally defined j equals the standard j, so, assuming , one obtains the dynamics of BM. It follows that the possible Bohmian paths are naively observable from a large enough ensemble. Furthermore, this justification for the Bohmian law of motion singles out x as the hidden variable, because (for example) the analogously defined momentum current is in general incompatible with the evolution of the momentum distribution. Finally I discuss how, in this setting, the usual quantum probabilities can be motivated from a Bayesian standpoint, via the principle of indifference.},

Two wave functions, the first preselected by the initial measurement and the second postselected by the final measurement, describe quantum systems at a single time. It is shown how this approach leads to a new concept: a weak value of an observable. Weak values represent novel characteristics of quantum systems between two measurements. They are outcomes of a standard measurement procedure that fulfills certain requirements of ‘‘weakness.’’ We call it weak measurement. Physical meaning, underlying mathematical structure, and prospects of practical usage of weak measurements are explored.},

Two techniques are discussed, namely, a tomographic reconstruction (in which the density matrix is linearly related to a set of measured quantities) and a maximum likelihood technique which requires numerical optimization (but has the advantage of producing density matrices that are always non-negative definite). In addition, a detailed error analysis is presented, allowing errors in quantities derived from the density matrix, such as the entropy or entanglement of formation, to be estimated. Examples based on down-conversion experiments are used to illustrate our results.},

Generally, orthogonal measurements have been discussed for this tomographic reconstruction. In this paper, we extend the tomographic reconstruction technique to two new regimes. First, we show how nonorthogonal measurements allow the reconstruction of the state of the system provided the measurements span the Hilbert space.

	abstract = {The variational quantum eigensolver (or VQE), first developed by Peruzzo et al. (2014), has received significant attention from the research community in recent years. It uses the variational principle to compute the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian, a problem that is central to quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Conventional computing methods are constrained in their accuracy due to the computational limits facing exact modeling of the exponentially growing electronic wavefunction for these many-electron systems. The VQE may be used to model these complex wavefunctions in polynomial time, making it one of the most promising near-term applications for quantum computing. One important advantage is that variational algorithms have been shown to present some degree of resilience to the noise in the quantum hardware. Finding a path to navigate the relevant literature has rapidly become an overwhelming task, with many methods promising to improve different parts of the algorithm, but without clear descriptions of how the diverse parts fit together. The potential practical advantages of the algorithm are also widely discussed in the literature, but with varying conclusions. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings suggesting excellent scaling of individual VQE components, studies have pointed out that their various pre-factors could be too large to reach a quantum computing advantage over conventional methods.
This review aims at disentangling the relevant literature to provide a comprehensive overview of the progress that has been made on the different parts of the algorithm, and to discuss future areas of research that are fundamental for the VQE to deliver on its promises. All the different components of the algorithm are reviewed in detail. These include the representation of Hamiltonians and wavefunctions on a quantum computer, the optimization process to find ground state energies, the post processing mitigation of quantum errors, and suggested best practices. We identify four main areas of future research: (1) optimal measurement schemes for reduction of circuit repetitions required; (2) large scale parallelization across many quantum computers; (3) ways to overcome the potential appearance of vanishing gradients in the optimization process for large systems, and how the number of iterations required for the optimization scales with system size; (4) the extent to which VQE suffers for quantum noise, and whether this noise can be mitigated in a tractable manner. The answers to these open research questions will determine the routes for the VQE to achieve quantum advantage as the quantum computing hardware scales up and as the noise levels are reduced.
We provide optimized recursion relations for homodyne tomography. We improve previous methods by mitigating the divergences intrinsic in the calculation of the pattern functions used previously, and detail how to implement the data analysis through Monte Carlo simulations. Our refinements are necessary for the reconstruction of excited quantum states which populate a high-dimensional subspace of the electromagnetic field Hilbert space.},

The final chapters discuss J. H. C. Whitehead's cell-complexes and their application to homotopy groups of complexes.},

	abstract = {A photon in an arbitrary polarization state cannot be cloned perfectly1,2. But suppose that at our disposal we have several copies of a photon in an unknown state. Is it possible to delete the information content of one or more of these photons by a physical process? Specifically, if two photons are in the same initial polarization state, is there a mechanism that produces one photon in the same initial state and the other in some standard polarization state? If this could be done, then one would create a standard blank state onto which one could copy an unknown state approximately, by deterministic cloning3,4 or exactly, by probabilistic cloning5,6. This could in principle be useful in quantum computation, where one could store new information in an already computed state by deleting the old information. Here we show, however, that the linearity of quantum theory does not allow us to delete a copy of an arbitrary quantum state perfectly. Though in a classical computer information can be deleted (reversibly) against a copy7, the analogous task cannot be accomplished, even irreversibly, with quantum information.},

	abstract = {Spacetime measurements and gravitational experiments are made by using objects, matter fields or particles and their mutual relationships. As a consequence, any operationally meaningful assertion about spacetime is in fact an assertion about the degrees of freedom of the matter (i.e. non gravitational) fields; those, say for definiteness, of the Standard Model of particle physics. As for any quantum theory, the dynamics of the matter fields can be described in terms of a unitary evolution of a state vector in a Hilbert space. By writing the Hilbert space as a generic tensor product of “subsystems” we analyse the evolution of a state vector on an information theoretical basis and attempt to recover the usual spacetime relations from the information exchanges between these subsystems. We consider generic interacting second quantized models with a finite number of fermionic degrees of freedom and characterize on physical grounds the tensor product structure associated with the class of “localized systems” and therefore with “position”. We find that in the case of free theories no spacetime relation is operationally definable. On the contrary, by applying the same procedure to the simple interacting model of a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain we recover the tensor product structure usually associated with “position”. Finally, we discuss the possible role of gravity in this framework.},

	abstract = {Any given prescription of quantum time travel necessarily endows a Hilbert space to the chronology-violating (CV) system on the closed timelike curve (CTC). However, under the two foremost models, Deutsch’s prescription (D-CTCs) and postselected teleportation (P-CTCs), the CV system is treated very differently: D-CTCs assign a definite form to the state on this system, while P-CTCs do not. To further explore this distinction, we present a methodology by which an operational notion of state may be assigned to their respective CV systems. This is accomplished via a conjunction of state tomography and weak measurements, with the latter being essential in leaving any notions of self-consistency intact. With this technique, we are able to verify the predictions of D-CTCs and, perhaps more significantly, operationally assign a state to the system on the P-CTC. We show that, for any given combination of chronology-respecting input and unitary interaction, it is always possible to recover the unique state on the P-CTC, and we provide a few specific examples in the context of select archetypal temporal paradoxes. We also demonstrate how this state may be derived from analysis of the P-CTC prescription itself, and we explore how it compares to its counterpart in the CV state predicted by D-CTCs.},

Quantum information theory is one of the key research areas, since it leads the way to vastly increased computing speeds by using quantum systems to store and process information. Quantum cryptography allows for secure communication of classified information. Research in the field of quantum informatics, including quantum information theory, is in progress in leading scientific centers throughout the world. The past years were marked with impressive progress made by several researchers in solution of some difficult problems, in particular, the additivity of the entropy characteristics of quantum channels. This suggests a need for a book that not only introduces the basic concepts of quantum information theory, but also presents in detail some of the latest achievements.},

Here we extend these techniques to multilevel qudits, as they may offer some advantages relative to qubit implementations. The arithmetic circuits presented here can be used as basic building blocks for higher level algorithms such as quantum phase estimation, quantum simulation, quantum optimization, etc. Detailed decomposition is given down to elementary two-level single- and two-qudit gates as such gates are the most appropriate for physical implementation. A complexity analysis is given after this decomposition step and it is shown that the depth of the circuits is linear in the number of qudits employed and quadratic in the dimension of each qudit while their quantum cost is quadratic in the number of the qudits and quadratic in the dimension.},

	abstract = {One of the major promises of quantum computing is the realization of SIMD (single instruction - multiple data) operations using the phenomenon of superposition. Since the dimension of the state space grows exponentially with the number of qubits, we can easily reach situations where we pay less than a single quantum gate per data point for data-processing instructions, which would be rather expensive in classical computing. Formulating such instructions in terms of quantum gates, however, still remains a challenging task. Laying out the foundational functions for more advanced data-processing is therefore a subject of paramount importance for advancing the realm of quantum computing. In this paper, we introduce the formalism of encoding so called-semi-boolean polynomials. As it turns out, arithmetic {\textbackslash}mathbb Z/2{\textasciicircum}n{\textbackslash}mathbb Z ring operations can be formulated as semi-boolean polynomial evaluations, which allows convenient generation of unsigned integer arithmetic quantum circuits. For arithmetic evaluations, the resulting algorithm has been known as Fourier-arithmetic. We extend this type of algorithm with additional features, such as ancilla-free in-place multiplication and integer coefficient polynomial evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce a tailor-made method for encoding signed integers succeeded by an encoding for arbitrary floating-point numbers. This representation of floating-point numbers and their processing can be applied to any quantum algorithm that performs unsigned modular integer arithmetic. We discuss some further performance enhancements of the semi boolean polynomial encoder and finally supply a complexity estimation. The application of our methods to a 32-bit unsigned integer multiplication demonstrated a 90\% circuit depth reduction compared to carry-ripple approaches.},

This protocol is achieved by simulating a closed timelike curve (a theoretical construct in which particles can traverse backward in time) using probabilistic methods. Remarkably, we find that stronger scrambling dynamics enhance the fidelity of the decoding process.

	abstract = {Born in the intersection between quantum mechanics and general relativity, indefinite causal structure is the idea that in the continuum of time, some sets of events do not have an inherent causal order between them. Process matrices, introduced by Oreshkov, Costa and Brukner (Nature Communications, 2012), define quantum information processing with indefinite causal structure -- a generalization of the operations allowed in standard quantum information processing, and to date, are the most studied such generalization. Araujo et al. (Physical Review A, 2017) defined the computational complexity of process matrices, and showed that polynomial-time process matrix computation is equivalent to standard polynomial-time quantum computation with access to a weakening of post-selection Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs), that are restricted to be \${\textbackslash}textit\{linear\}\$. Araujo et al. accordingly defined the complexity class for efficient process matrix computation as \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{BQP\}\_\{{\textbackslash}ell CTC\}\$ (which trivially contains \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{BQP\}\$), and posed the open question of whether \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{BQP\}\_\{{\textbackslash}ell CTC\}\$ contains computational tasks that are outside \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{BQP\}\$. In this work we solve this open question under a widely believed hardness assumption, by showing that \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{NP\} {\textbackslash}subseteq {\textbackslash}mathbf\{BQP\}\_\{{\textbackslash}ell CTC\}\$. Our solution is captured by an even more restricted subset of process matrices that are purifiable (Araujo et al., Quantum, 2017), which (1) is conjectured more likely to be physical than arbitrary process matrices, and (2) is equivalent to polynomial-time quantum computation with access to \${\textbackslash}textit\{unitary\}\$ (which are in particular linear) post-selection CTCs. Conceptually, our work shows that the previously held belief, that non-linearity is what enables CTCs to solve \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{NP\}\$, is false, and raises the importance of understanding whether purifiable process matrices are physical or not.},

We choose the curve so that the generator of evolution in proper time is the angular momentum. Using Wigner’s theorem, we prove that the energy levels internal to the spaceship must undergo spontaneous discretization. The level separation turns out to be finely tuned so that, after completing a roundtrip of the curve, all systems are back to their initial state. This implies, for example, that the memories of an observer inside the spaceship are necessarily erased by the end of the journey. More in general, if there is an increase in entropy, a Poincaré cycle will eventually reverse it by the end of the loop, forcing entropy to decrease back to its initial value. We show that such decrease in entropy is in agreement with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The non-existence of time-travel paradoxes follows as a rigorous corollary of our analysis.},

This is a purely special-relativistic argument, using the fact that for observers in two frames of reference, separated by a spacelike interval, the non-causal (spacelike) future of one observer includes part of the causal past of the other. In this paper we provide a concrete realization of this argument in a curved general-relativistic spacetime, using warp drives as the means of faster-than-light travel. By generalizing the usual warp drive metric to allow for a non-unit lapse function, we allow the warp drive to switch between reference frames in a purely geometric way. With an additional modification allowing the warp drive to have compact support, this permits us to glue two warp drives together to construct a closed timelike geodesic, such that a test particle following the geodesics of the two warp drives travels back to its own past. This provides a precise mathematical model for the connection between faster-than-light travel and time travel in general relativity, and the first such model to be explicitly formulated using two warp drives. We also give a detailed discussion of weak energy condition violations in the non-unit-lapse warp drive.},

	abstract = {In a large class of nonlocal as well as local higher derivative theories minimally coupled to the matter sector, we investigate the exactness of two different classes of homogeneous Gödel-type solutions, which may or may not allow closed time-like curves (CTC). Our analysis is limited to spacetimes solving the Einstein’s EoM, thus we can not exclude the presence of other Gödel-type solutions solving the EoM of local and nonlocal higher derivative theories but not the Einstein’s EoM. It turns out that the homogeneous Gödel spacetimes without CTC are basically exact solutions for all theories, while the metrics with CTC are not exact solutions of (super-)renormalizable local or nonlocal gravitational theories. Hence, the quantum renormalizability property excludes theories suffering of the Gödel’s causality violation. We also comment about nonlocal gravity non-minimally coupled to matter. In this class of theories, all the Gödel’s spacetimes, with or without CTC, are exact solutions at classical level. However, the quantum corrections, although perturbative, very likely spoil the exactness of such solutions. Therefore, we can state that the Gödel’s Universes with CTC and the super-renormalizability are mutually exclusive.},

In this paper we propose a practical method for discriminating multiple nonorthogonal states, by using a previously known quantum circuit designed to simulate DCTCs. This method relies on multiple copies of an input state, multiple iterations of the circuit, and a fixed set of unitary operations. We first characterize the performance of this circuit and study its asymptotic behavior. We also show how it can be equivalently recast as a local adaptive circuit that may be implemented simply in an experiment. Finally, we prove that our state discrimination strategy achieves the multiple Chernoff bound when discriminating an arbitrary set of pure qubit states.},

For this purpose, we study a family of two-dimensional spacetimes that model very broad classes of wormhole time machines. The behavior of strongly coupled conformal theories in these spacetimes is then holographically described by three-dimensional AdS bulk geometries that we explicitly construct. The dual bulk spacetime is free from any divergences, but splits into two disconnected components, without and with CTCs, which are joined only through the boundary; then, passages across the chronology horizon are impossible for any field excitations. In dual terms, the strong self-interaction of the CFT decouples the pathological part from the rest of the spacetime. We also find that entangling the CFTs in two separate time machines connects them through a traversable bulk wormhole. Nevertheless, any entanglement-assisted chronology violations will be prevented by quantum bulk corrections, i.e., subleading 1/N effects, again without needing any gravitational backreaction of the CFT. We are led to speculate that chronology may be protected without involving Planck scale physics.},

It was also suggested that this is a generic phenomenon that calls for a deeper intuitive physical understanding. In this short note, we point out—with Kerr–Taub–NUT as an example—that CTCs are counter-rotating with respect to the local angular velocity of the spacetime, not the global angular momentum, nor the angular velocity of the black hole horizon, which makes the physical interpretation of CTCs being “caused” by a rotating source even more problematic.},

	abstract = {The General Theory of Relativity has been an extremely successful theory, with a well established experimental footing, at least for weak gravitational fields. Its predictions range from the existence of black holes, gravitational radiation to the cosmological models, predicting a primordial beginning, namely the big-bang. All these solutions have been obtained by first considering a plausible distribution of matter, and through the Einstein field equation, the spacetime metric of the geometry is determined. However, one may solve the Einstein field equation in the reverse direction, namely, one first considers an interesting and exotic spacetime metric, then finds the matter source responsible for the respective geometry. In this manner, it was found that some of these solutions possess a peculiar property, namely 'exotic matter,' involving a stress-energy tensor that violates the null energy condition. These geometries also allow closed timelike curves, with the respective causality violations. These solutions are primarily useful as 'gedanken-experiments' and as a theoretician's probe of the foundations of general relativity, and include traversable wormholes and superluminal 'warp drive' spacetimes. Thus, one may be tempted to denote these geometries as 'exotic' solutions of the Einstein field equation, as they violate the energy conditions and generate closed timelike curves. In this article, in addition to extensively exploring interesting features, in particular, the physical properties and characteristics of these 'exotic spacetimes,' we also analyze other non-trivial general relativistic geometries which generate closed timelike curves.},

	abstract = {The conceptual definition and understanding of time, both quantitatively and qualitatively is of the utmost difficulty and importance. As time is incorporated into the proper structure of the fabric of spacetime, it is interesting to note that General Relativity is contaminated with non-trivial geometries which generate closed timelike curves. A closed timelike curve (CTC) allows time travel, in the sense that an observer that travels on a trajectory in spacetime along this curve, may return to an event before his departure. This fact apparently violates causality, therefore time travel and it's associated paradoxes have to be treated with great caution. The paradoxes fall into two broad groups, namely the consistency paradoxes and the causal loops. A great variety of solutions to the Einstein field equations containing CTCs exist and it seems that two particularly notorious features stand out. Solutions with a tipping over of the light cones due to a rotation about a cylindrically symmetric axis and solutions that violate the energy conditions. All these aspects are analyzed in this review paper.},

We verify the non-perturbative violation of the classical energy conditions of the Alcubierre and Natario warp drive spacetimes and apply linearized gravity to the weak-field warp drive, testing the energy conditions to first and second order of the non-relativistic warp-bubble velocity. We are primarily interested in a secondary feature of the warp drive that has not previously been remarked upon, if it could be built, the warp drive would be an example of a "reaction-less drive". For both the Alcubierre and Natario warp drives we find that the occurrence of significant energy condition violations is not just a high-speed effect, but that the violations persist even at arbitrarily low speeds. An interesting feature of this construction is that it is now meaningful to place a finite mass spaceship at the center of the warp bubble, and compare the warp field energy with the mass-energy of the spaceship. There is no hope of doing this in Alcubierre's original version of the warp-field, since by definition the point in the center of the warp bubble moves on a geodesic and is "massless". That is, in Alcubierre's original formalism and in the Natario formalism the spaceship is always treated as a test particle, while in the linearized theory we can treat the spaceship as a finite mass object. For both the Alcubierre and Natario warp drives we find that even at low speeds the net (negative) energy stored in the warp fields must be a significant fraction of the mass of the spaceship.},
