In this section, a brief but (mostly) complete introduction to quantum mechanics and its mathematical description is presented. This is intended to serve as a reference to the quantum mechanics implemented within the Qhronology package, in addition to providing a pedagogical summary of the basic physics relevant to this project. Included are discussions on antichronological time travel from the perspectives of both classical and quantum physics. The exposition on these topics is designed to be sufficiently comprehensive so as to provide a pathway for the determined reader to make a foray into the fascinating area of research that is the quantum mechanics of time travel.
